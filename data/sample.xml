'''April''' is the fourth [[month]] of the [[year]]. It has 30 [[day]]s. The name April comes from that [[Latin]] word ''aperire'' which means &quot;to open&quot;. This probably refers to growing [[plant]]s in spring. April begins on the same day of week as [[July]] in all years and also [[January]] in leap years.

April's [[flower]] is the [[Sweet Pea]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[diamond]]. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.

== April in poetry ==
[[poetry|Poets]] use ''April'' to mean the end of winter. For example: ''April showers bring [[May]] flowers.''

== Events in April ==
* [[April Fools' Day]] occurs on [[April 1]].
* [[Easter]] occurs on a [[week|Sunday]] between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]].
* [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] celebrate [[ANZAC Day]] on 25 April. [http://www.awm.gov.au/dawn/spirit/meaning.asp ANZAC] means Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, and began in 1915.

'''August''' is the eighth [[month]] of the [[year]]. It has 31 [[day]]s. 

This month was first called ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], because it was the sixth month in the old [[Roman calendar]]. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]]. It was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the [[decemvirs]] about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree).

August is named for [[Augustus Caesar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;infoplease&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=History of August |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/history-of-august.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The month has 31 days because the Roman senate wanted as many days as [[Julius Caesar|Julius Caesar's]] month [[July]].&lt;ref name=&quot;infoplease&quot; /&gt; August is in summer, after July and before September.

An extra day was moved from February in order to make the month of August seem more important.  February gets its day back when the [[leap year]] adjustment is made. &lt;ref name=&quot;infoplease&quot; /&gt;

August's flower is the [[Gladiolus]] with the birthstone being [[peridot]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Chemin montant dans les hautes herbes.png|thumb|300px|This painting by [[Renoir]] is a work of art.]]

The word '''art''' is used to describe some activities or creations of [[human beings]] that have importance to the human [[mind]], regarding an attraction to the human [[senses]]. Therefore, art is made when a human expresses himself or herself. Some art is useful in a practical sense, such as a sculptured clay [[bowl]] that one can put things in. Many people disagree on how to define art. Many people say people are driven to make art due to their inner [[creativity]]. Art includes [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpting]], [[photography]], [[Performing arts|performance art]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[poetry]], [[prose]] and [[theatre]].

== Types of art ==
* Visual Art/The Graphic Arts/Tactile Art  (expression by making [[image]]s and [[sight]]s): [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[sculpting]], [[photography]], [[Movie|filming]], [[fashion]]
* Auditory Art (expression by making [[sound]]s): [[music]], [[singing]]
* Performing Art/The Dramatic Arts (expression using the body): [[dance]], [[acting]], [[singing]]
* Fine Art (expression by making something [[Beauty|beautiful]] or appealing to the [[emotion]]s): [[poetry]], [[writing]] ([[literature]])
* Culinary Art (expression by making [[flavor]]s and [[taste]]s): [[cooking]] 
* The Mechanical Arts (expression by building objects and structures): [[architecture]]

== What &quot;Art&quot; Means ==
Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the human mind or spirit.

An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the amount of people who can relate to it, and how much people appreciate it. 

The first and broadest sense of &quot;art&quot; means &quot;arrangement&quot; or &quot;to arrange.&quot; In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design.

Art can also be a form of expression of emotion. The artist may feel a certain emotion and feels there is no other way to express it than to create something that means something to them. Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience. Though if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work will become publicly successful.

== History of art ==

There are sculptures, [[cave paintings]], rock paintings and [[petroglyphs]] dating from the Upper Paleolithic era, about thirty five thousand (35,000) years ago, 

All of the great ancient civilizations, such as Ancient [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Greece]], [[Rome]] or [[Arabia]] had works and styles of art. In the [[Middle Ages]], most of the art in [[Europe]] showed Biblical stories in [[paintings]], [[stained glass]] windows, and [[mosaic]] tile floors and walls.

[[Islamic]] art includes [[geometric]] patterns, Islamic [[calligraphy]], and [[architecture]]. In [[India]] and [[Tibet]], painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included [[jade]] carving, bronzework, [[pottery]], [[poetry]], calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty. 

In Europe, after the Middle Ages, (which some people call the [[Mediaeval Period]] or the &quot;[[Dark Ages]]&quot;) there was a &quot;[[Renaissance]]&quot; which means &quot;rebirth&quot;. People rediscovered [[science]] and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented [[linear perspective]] where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other. 

In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to [[Modernity]] created many new painting styles such as [[Classicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism]], and [[Impressionism]]. The history of twentieth century art includes [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, and [[Surrealism]], and [[Minimalism]].

== Roles of art ==

In some [[society|societies]], people think that art belongs to the person who made it, such as Indigenous Aboriginal Australian Art. They think that the artist put his or her &quot;[[talent]]&quot; into the art. In this view, the art is the [[property]] of the artist. 

In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its [[social capital]] into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a [[collective]] that has made the art, through the artist.

=== Functions of art ===

The [[function]]s of art include&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bagdasaryan |first=Nadejda |title=Culturology |year=2000 |language=Russian |isbn=5-06-003475-5 |pages=511 |chapter=7. Art as a phenomenon of culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

1) cognitive function

:Works of art let us know about what the author knew, and about what the surrounding of the author were like.

2) aesthetic function

:Works of art are more or less harmonic and bring pleasure, a sensation of beauty.

3) prognostic function

:Some artists draw what they see the future like, and some of them are right...

4) recreation function

:Art makes us think about it, not about reality; we have a rest.

5) value function

:What did the artist value? What aims did he like/dislike in human activity? This usually is clearly seen in artists' works.

6) didactic function

: What message, criticism or political change did the artist wish to  achieve ?

'''A''' is the first letter of the [[English language|English]] [[alphabet]]. '''a''' is a usual [[symbol]] for a low central [[vowel]], as in &quot;father&quot;; the English long '''a''' (ā) is pronounced as a [[diphthong]] of ĕ and y. The corresponding letter of the [[Greek alphabet]] is named [[alpha]]. Alpha and [[omega (letter)|omega]], the last letter of the Greek alphabet, means the beginning and the end. In [[musical notation]] the letter A is the symbol of a note in the scale, below [[B]] and above [[G]].

* [[A]] is the letter that was formerly used to represent a team in an old [[TV]] show, [[The A Team]].

[[Image:Air composition pie chart.JPG|thumb|240px|This is what the air is made of.]]
[[Image:Kawasaki-Electric Fan.jpg|thumb|A [[wikt:fan|fan]] is used to move air.]]
'''Air''' means [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]]. It is the clear [[gas]] we live in and [[breathe]] in. It has an indefinite shape and volume.It has no [[color]] or [[odor|smell]]. It has [[mass]] and [[weight]]. It is a [[matter]] as it has mass and weight. Air creates [[atmosphere pressure]]. There is no air in the [[vacuum]] and [[cosmos]]. 

Air is a [[mixture]] of 78.03% [[nitrogen]], 20.99% [[oxygen]], 0.94% [[argon]], 0.03% [[carbon dioxide]], 0.01% [[hydrogen]], 0.00123% [[Neon]], 0.0004% [[helium]], 0.00005% [[krypton]], 0.000006% [[xenon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://mistupid.com/chemistry/aircomp.htm|title=composition of air}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans need the [[oxygen]] in the air to live. In the [[human body]], the [[lung]]s give oxygen to the [[blood]], and give back [[carbon dioxide]] to the air. [[Plants]] and [[animals]] also need air to live: it is very important to everyone.

The [[wind]] is moving air.  Air can be polluted from some gases (such as [[ozone]] and [[carbon monoxide]]), [[smoke]], and [[ash]]. Some believe that this [[pollution]] may be one of the [[cause]]s of [[global warming]].

Aircraft use [[propeller|propellers]] to move air over a [[wing]], which allows them to [[flight|fly]].

Without air, humans would be dead.

{{shortcut|[[WP:ADMIN]]&lt;br /&gt;[[WP:SYSOP]]&lt;br /&gt;[[WP:BUR]]&lt;br /&gt;[[WP:A]]}}
[[File:Admin mop.PNG|thumbnail|This is the symbol of a Wikipedia administrator. It shows the site's logo with a [[mop]], as administrators are often linked to [[janitor]]s.]]
'''Administrators''', also called '''admins''' or '''sysops''' ('''sys'''tem '''op'''erators), are users who can use special [[Special:ListGroupRights/Admin|tools]] that help keep Wikipedia running smoothly.  They can use these tools because they are trusted by the community, but this does not make them better or more important than anybody else.  The opinion of an administrator, for example, should not be counted as more important than the opinion of a person who chooses to change Wikipedia with an IP address just because they have administrator rights.

''There are currently {{NUMBEROFADMINS}} administrators.''

=== Administrative tools ===
==== Delete ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|delete]] and undelete pages. Pages can be deleted because of a [[WP:RFD|request for deletion]] or they can be [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Quick deletion|quickly deleted]] under policy. Undeletion requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion]].

=====Revision Delete=====
Administrators can also hide [[Help:Diff|revisions]] of a page from public view by deleting them. Only other administrators can see the deleted revisions. Revisions should only be hidden in special cases, listed [[Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Revision deletion|here]].

==== Protect ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|protect]], unprotect and change protected pages, including those in the [[:en:Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace|MediaWiki namespace]], and other users' personal [[Javascript]] or [[CSS]] (.js or .css) files.
* Requests for protection can be made at [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard]]. Please remember that pages are usually protected when there is [[WP:VAND|vandalism]] or an [[WP:edit war|edit war]] happening, and not to prevent vandalism that has not happened.

==== Block ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Blocks and bans|block]] and unblock users who are causing trouble.
* Requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress]] but only if the user has been disruptive.  Requests made in [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|bad faith]] may result in you yourself being blocked. Blocks are different to bans.

==== Rollback ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Rollback|rollback changes]]. This lets them quickly undo all the changes by a user to a page if they are the newest changes. The change is automatically marked as a [[Help:small change|small change]] and gives the following [[WP:Change summary|change summary]]:

:'''m''' ''Reverted changes by '''User A''' ('''talk''') to last version by '''User B'''

To use bot rollback, you type in the URL &lt;nowiki&gt;http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Example&amp;bot=1  &lt;/nowiki&gt; replacing Example with the user name, and then you can rollback changes and hide them from the recent changes along with the rolled back edit, but this should only be used for large amounts of vandalism, like with a [[:m:vandalbot|vandalbot]].
* Users can also be given the rollback tool. You can make requests at [[WP:RFRB|requests for rollback]].

==== Import pages ====
They can [[meta:Import|import]] pages from other Wikipedias.

==== View unwatched pages ====
They can see which pages are not on someone's watchlist.

==== Manage userrights ====
They can give some user rights to others. They can add or remove rollback, IP block exempt and the flood flag for all accounts.

== Bureaucrat ==
A '''bureaucrat''' can do a few more things than an administrator, but they should only use these while acting on [[WP:CON|consensus]]. Bureaucrats can give administrator or bureaucrat rights to other users, following a successful request on [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions]]. On the Simple English Wikipedia bureaucrats can also remove administrator status following a successful request for removal of rights (deadminship), or in certain emergency situations for protection of the wiki. They can also &quot;flag&quot; [[Wikipedia:Bot|bots]], which means to hide their contributions from the new changes and put them in the bot group. Bureaucrats can also help users who want to [[:meta:Changing username|change their username]]. Requests for name changes should be made directly to the talk page of one of the listed bureaucrats, or on [[Wikipedia:Changing username]].

== CheckUser ==
A select few administrators have checkuser access. They can see the [[IP address]]es of named editors. They can also see which users edit from certain IP addresses, as well as some information on the [[browser]] used for editing. There are many rules as to who can become a CheckUser, and how CheckUsers have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:CheckUser policy|CheckUser policy]] page. CheckUsers can help fight [[vandalism]] this way. CheckUser requests can be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser]].

== Oversighter ==
Certain administrators have oversighter access. Page [[:en:Help:Diff|revisions]] can be hidden or removed from the public history so they can only be seen by other oversighters and [[:m:System administrators|developers]]. The right is a sensitive one, and removes private data that can cause legal problems. There are many rules as to who can become an oversighter, and how oversighters have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:Oversight|Oversighter policy]] page. Oversighters can help fight [[wp:VAN|vandalism]] this way. Oversighter requests should only be made privately, and not on Wikipedia. See the [[WP:OS|Oversighter]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Spain]] is divided in 17 parts called '''autonomous communities'''. ''Autonomous'' means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power, its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power. These are similar, but NOT the same, to states in the United States of America, for example.

Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In [[1978]] these parts came together, making the autonomous communities. 
Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called &quot;historic communities&quot;: Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia.

The Spanish language is official language in every autonomous commmunity but six autonomous communities have also other official languages:
* [[Catalonia]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]])
* [[Valencian Community]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], also called [[Valencian]] there)
* [[Balearic Islands]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]])
* [[Galicia]] ([[Galician language|Galician]])
* [[Basque Country]] ([[Basque language|Basque]])
* [[Navarre]] ([[basque language|Basque]], but only in the north)

List of the autonomous communities, with their Capital city (the place where the government has its offices):

* [[Andalucia]] (its capital is [[Sevilla]])
* [[Aragon]] (its capital is [[Zaragoza]])
* [[Asturias]] (its capital is [[Oviedo]])
* [[Balearic Islands]] (its capital is [[Palma de Mallorca]])
* [[Basque Country]] (its capital is [[Vitoria]])
* [[Canarian islands]] (it has two capitals - [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] and [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]])
* [[Cantabria]] (its capital is [[Santander]])
* [[Castile-La Mancha]] (its capital is [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]])
* [[Castile and Leon]] (its capital is [[Valladolid]])
* [[Catalonia]] (its capital is [[Barcelona]])
* [[Extremadura]] (its capital is [[Mérida]])
* [[Galicia]] (its capital is [[Santiago de Compostela]])
* [[La Rioja]] (its capital is [[Logroño]])
* [[Madrid]] (its capital is [[Madrid]])
* [[Murcia]] (its capital is [[Murcia]])
* [[Navarre]] (its capital is [[Pamplona]])
* [[Valencian Community]] (its capital is [[Valencia]])

Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. They are called &quot;autonomous cities&quot; and have simultaneously the majority of the power of an autonomous community and also power of provinces and power of municipalities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Alan Turing Memorial Closer.jpg|right|thumb|A [[statue]] of Alan Turning]]
'''Alan Mathison Turing''' ([[June 23]], [[1912]] - [[June 7]], [[1954]]) was an [[England|English]] [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]].

He was one of the first people to work with modern digital [[computer]]s. He was the first person to think of using a computer for different things. He told people that computers could run different [[Computer program|programs]]. Turing introduced the idea of a [[Turing machine]] in 1936. The machine was imaginary, and ran a set of commands. 

Turing also thought of the [[Turing test]]. The Turing test is a test to see if a person can tell the difference between another person and a computer.

During the [[Second World War]], Turing was a main participant in the efforts to break German [[cipher]]s. On the basis of [[cryptanalysis]] he helped to break both the [[Enigma machine]] and the [[Lorenz SZ 40/42]] (a teletype cipher attachment codenamed &quot;Tunny&quot; by the British), and was, for a time, head of [[Hut 8]], the section responsible for reading [[Germany|German]] naval signals.

Alan Turing was a [[gay]] man. In [[1952]], Turing admitted having sex with a man. At that time in [[England]], [[homosexuality]] was a crime. He was tried and convicted of this crime in a British court. and was forced to make a choice. He had to choose between going to jail or &quot;chemical castration&quot; (taking female [[hormone]]s like [[estrogen]] to lower his sex drive). He chose the hormones. But this made him impotent (unable to have sex) and made him grow [[breast]]s. After suffering these effects for two years, he committed [[suicide]] (killed himself) with an [[apple]] poisoned with [[cyanide]] in [[1954]]. 

The treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong, going against [[medical ethics]] and international laws of [[human rights]], and [[malpractice]] by most [[doctor]]s.

'''Andouille''' is a type of [[pork]] [[sausage]]. It is spicy (hot in taste) and smoked. There are different kinds, all with different combinations of pork [[meat]], [[fat]], [[intestines]] (tubes going to the [[stomach]]), and [[tripe]] (the wall of the stomach). Andouille sausage first came from [[France]] or [[Germany]] (no-one is sure), but the name indicates that it may have come out from France, and the most famous sort in the [[United States|USA]] is the &quot;Cajun&quot; style. 

Other sorts are &quot;French andouille&quot; and &quot;German andouille&quot;; they are less spicy than Cajun. Cajun has extra [[sodium chloride|salt]], [[black pepper]], and [[garlic]]. Andouille makers smoke the sausages over pecan wood and sugar cane for a maximum of seven or eight hours, at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Farming''' is the growing of [[crop]]s or keeping of animals by people for [[food]] and [[raw material]]s. Farming can be called agriculture.
[[File:Grand-Reng JPG01.jpg|thumb|200px|Flax]]
== Overview ==
Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like [[flower]]s, [[ornamental]] plants (plants people use to improve the look of their homes) and [[nursery]] [[plant]]s (plants people buy to grow food on their own farms and land), manure or dung, [[animal hides]] (skins or furs), [[leather]], industrial chemicals ([[starch]], [[ethanol]], and [[plastic]]s), [[fiber]]s ([[cotton]], [[wool]], [[cannabis|hemp]], and [[flax]]), fuels ([[methane]], [[biodiesel]], [[biomass]]), and [[drug]]s ([[biopharmaceuticals]], [[marijuana]], [[opium]])

Agriculture started at least about 10,000 years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is. Agriculture and [[domestication]] started in the [[Fertile Crescent]] in East [[Africa]] and in the [[Middle East]]. The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], and [[Egypt]]. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than gathering on the same amount of land.

Farming actually started with the first nations. They might have originally kept tethered animals for extra food. Farmers often help each other out whenever they can.{{proof}} Scientists have many theories about how farming started but most start with first nations, around the end of the ice age (about ten thousand years ago).

Many people live by doing what is called [[subsistence agriculture]], on a small farm. Only the farmer's family lives on the farm. Subsistence agriculture is growing only enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals. Extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow. The [[yield]] is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and the yield is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less [[education|educated]], and they have less [[money]] to buy equipment. When yields are low, [[forests]] are sometimes cut to provide new land to grow more food. This is good in the [[short term]], but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years.

In rich countries, farms are often much larger. The yield on farms has gotten bigger in the last one hundred years because farmers are able to grow better [[varieties]] of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests. Many farms also use machines, which cut down on the number of people needed to farm the land. This results in fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to eat more. This kind of [[intensive agriculture]] comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, [[pesticides]] (chemicals that kill bugs), and [[herbicide]]s (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can [[pollute]] the [[soil]] or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by [[erosion]] (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. [[Irrigation]] (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. Having fewer farmers also changes society and can make a country less able to feed itself in bad times.

=== Agriculture techniques ===
There are many ways to grow crops and animals. Some of them are :
* [[Hydroponic]]
* [[Tillage]] by [[plough]]
* [[Irrigation]] 
* [[Fertilizer]]s 
* [[Crop rotation]]
* [[Weed]] removal
* [[Breeding]]
* [[Agricultural fencing|Fencing]]
* [[Ranching]]

Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and [[nutrition]]al value. They also choose plants that are more resistant to disease, more tolerant to drought, and easier to harvest. Centuries of careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. The crops produce better yield with other techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, irrigation).

Some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries, and genetically modify these plants to improve them. They then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries.

New plants were created with [[genetic engineering]]. One example of [[genetic engineering]] is modifying a plant to resist an herbicide.

== Food ==
It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. They say it is sometimes not safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture.

Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries.

Intensive agriculture is mostly done in wealthier countries. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. Organic farming is using only natural products and at times fruits. Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process.

[[Agricultural policy]] focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include:

* [[Food safety]]: to be sure that the food supply is safe.
* [[Food security]]: to be sure there is enough food for everyone.
* [[Food quality]]: to be sure the food is of good quality.

== Problems in agriculture ==
There are some serious problems that face people trying to grow food today.
These include:
* [[Erosion]]
* [[Diseases]]
* [[Pests]]
* [[Weed]]s
* [[Drought]]
* [[Rainfall]]
* Many non-arable lands

== Crops ==
The major crops produced in the world in 2002, are maize (corn), wheat, rice, and cotton.

:Maize 624 millions of metric tons
:Wheat 570 millions of metric tons
:Rice 381.1 millions of metric tons
:Cotton 96.5 millions of metric tons

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arithmetic''' is what we call working with [[number]]s. It is a part of [[mathematics]]. The four basic arithmetic operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[division]]. 

Harder arithmetic includes working with [[signed number]]s, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], and [[decimal]]s, and taking [[power (math)|powers]] and [[root (math)|roots]].

Most people learn arithmetic in grade school, but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned. Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic, and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic. A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include [[carpenter]]s, [[plumber]]s, [[automobile mechanic|auto mechanics]], [[accountant]]s, [[architect]]s, [[doctor]]s, and [[nurse]]s. Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics, [[science]], and [[engineering]]. 

A [[Calculator]] can be used to do arithmetic.

== Examples of arithmetic ==

* 2 + 3 = 5 (adding is [[transitive]]: 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2)

* 7 - 5 = 2 (subtracting is not transitive: 7 - 5 is different from 5 - 7)

* 3 * 4 = 12 (multiplying is transitive: 3 * 4 is the same as 4 * 3)

* 6 / 2 = 3 (dividing is not transitive: 6 / 2 is different from 2 / 6)

[[Image:Addition.gif|thumb|220px|Addition ]]

'''Addition''' is the [[mathematics|mathematical]] way of putting things together.

== Arithmetic ==

In [[arithmetic]], addition is finding the total of two or more [[number]]s. The sign for addition is &quot;+&quot;. The name for the sign &quot;+&quot; is &quot;plus&quot;.  

=== Counting examples ===
For example, there are [[wikt:object|objects]] in two [[group]]s. The objects are small circles: &quot;o&quot;. One group has five of these objects. The other group has 3 of these objects. To find the total number of objects in both groups, the objects can be counted. Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group.  

====Adding====
Another method is to add the numbers of objects in group A and group B, since they are already counted. In symbols:

:{{math|5 + 3}}

There are [[rule]]s for adding numbers that people [[learn]]. There are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines. The rule says that:

:{{math|{{aao|5|3|+}}}}

In another counting example, Sally and Bill have 2 children. Sally and Bill get 3 more children. Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children.

===A measurement example===
Tom wants to know the distance between his house and Sally's house. Bob's house is 300 meters  east of Tom's house. Sally's house is 120 meters east of Bob's house:

:Tom's house&lt;------------300 meters--------------&gt;Bob's house&lt;-----120 meters-----&gt;Sally's house

The distance from Tom's house to Sally's house can be found by adding the distances already measured. The distance from Tom's house to Bob's house added to the distance from Bob's house to Sally's house is the same as the distance from Tom's house to Sally's house. That is, three hundred (300) meters plus 120 meters.
:{{math|{{aao|300|120|+}}}}

== Addition as increase ==
Addition can also mean to make bigger.

=== Example of addition as increase ===
* For example, Tom has a house. Tom puts a new room on the house. This new room is called an addition.

* John is making [[food]]. To make the food [[taste]] better, John puts [[salt]] in the food. That is, John adds salt to the food. The [[salt]] is an addition to the food.

'''Australia''' is a [[country]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] between the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Indian Ocean]].  Its official name is the '''Commonwealth of Australia'''. Australia is the sixth biggest country in the world by landmass.

22 million people live in Australia. About 60% live in and around the mainland state capitals of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Adelaide]]. Australia's capital city is [[Canberra]].

Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[New Guinea]] and other islands on the Australian [[tectonic plate]] are together called [[Australasia]]. They form one of the world's great [[ecozone]]s. When other Pacific islands are included, the term is [[Oceania]].

== Geography ==
[[File:As-map.png|thumbnail|left|Map of Australia]]
Australia's landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometers is on the Indo-Australian plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Kate | year=2008 | title=National Geographic Australia | publisher=Horupu | location=Tokyo | pages=pp.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The continent of Australia, including the island of Tasmania, was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago. Because of this, many [[animals]] and [[plants]] live in Australia that are not found anywhere else. These include animals like the [[kangaroo]], the [[koala]], the [[emu]], the [[kookaburra]], and the [[platypus]].

People first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the [[Australian Aborigine]]s. For the history of Australia, see [[History of Australia]].

Most of the Australian colonies, having been settled from [[Britain]], became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on [[1 January]] [[1901]]. The first [[Prime Minister of Australia]] was [[Edmund Barton]] in [[1901]]. Australia is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Queen Elizabeth II|Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia.

=== Regions and cities ===
{{seealso|List of Cities in Australia}}
Australia has six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[Western Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cummins | first=Brian R. | year=1990 | title=Australia | publisher= the Australian Government Publishing Service | location=Canberra | pages= 16-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The two major mainland territories are the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT).

In July [[2007]] Australia had just over 21 million people. Most Australians live in cities along the coast, such as [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Darwin, Australia|Darwin]], [[Hobart]] and [[Adelaide]]. The largest inland city is [[Canberra]], which is also the nation's capital. The largest city is Sydney&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Oceania South Pole | author= Tanabe Yu | year= 1997 | publisher= Asakura Bookstore | location= Shinjyuku ward | page= 3179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although Australia is a very big country, a lot of the land is very dry. The middle of the continent is mostly [[desert]]. Only the areas around the east, west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable [[climate]] (not too hot) for many [[farm]]s and [[cities]].

== History ==
=== Aboriginal people ===
[[File:Corroboree.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Arrernte men of Central Australia in a [[Corroboree]] in 1900.]]

The [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aboriginal]] people arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The history of Australia |author=Takao Fujikawa |year=2004|publisher=Yuhikaku ARMA |location=Tokyo |pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the Cumberland Plain where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees.{{cite}} This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.

Aboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]].{{cite}} The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The [[boomerang]] was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.

The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.

=== Terra Australis ===
In the 1600s, [[Dutch]] merchants traded with the islands of [[Batavia]] (now [[Indonesia]]), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch Governor, van Diemen, sent [[Abel Tasman]] on a voyage of discovery and he found [[Tasmania]], which he named [[Van Diemen's Land]]. Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.

The [[British Government]] were sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain [[James Cook]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. His ship, ''[[HMS Endeavour]]'', carried the famous scientists, Sir [[Joseph Banks]] and Dr Solander who were going to [[Tahiti]] where they would watch the planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] pass in front of the [[Sun]]. Captain Cook's secret mission was to find &quot;Terra Australis&quot; (the Land of the South).

The voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found [[New Zealand]] and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the [[horizon]]. Captain Cook named that bit of land [[Point Hicks]]. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw &quot;New South Wales&quot;. At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collect hundreds of plants to take back to England.

Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the Government that no-one owned the land. This was to cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.

=== Settlement ===
[[File:The Founding of Australia.jpg|thumb|Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] raises the British flag at [[Sydney]] in 1788.]]

In the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and gaols were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hanged for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol.  Often they were sent away to the British Colonies in America. But in the 1770's, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more. 

By the 1780s the [[gaol]]s ([[jail]]s) of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The Government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the [[First Fleet]] of eleven ships set sail from [[Portsmouth]] carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain [[Arthur Phillip]]. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay, because of the plants found there by the two scientists.

Captain Phillip found that [[Botany Bay]] was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbour which he said was &quot;the finest harbour in the world!&quot; There were many small bays on the harbour so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On the 26th January, [[1788]], the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of King George III of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney. 

For the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brickmaker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. The cattle all escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. There was a grave danger that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation. 

Somehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to [[Norfolk Island]] and to [[Van Diemen's Land]] (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England. 

While the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that of in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.

=== Exploration ===
[[File:Ln-Governor-Lachlan macquarie.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was the 5th [[Governor of New South Wales]] and one who though that Australia could be a rich and free place.]]

Because Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on.
When the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the [[Blue Mountains]]. They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813 [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson]] and a 17 year-old called [[William Charles Wentworth]] crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the Governor, [[Lachlan Macquarie]] founded the town of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] on the other side, 100 miles from Sydney.

Some people, like Captain [[Charles Sturt]] were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like [[Burke and Wills]]. [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major [[Thomas Mitchell]] was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The Henty brothers had come from [[Tasmania]], had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine.

===Self government===
 
The goldrushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the goldrushes had made some poor people, very rich.

Convict transportation ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by Governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. [[William Wentworth]] started the [[Australian Patriotic Association]] (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]]. In 1840, the some city councils started and some people could vot. [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] had its first elections in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. In 1855, limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, the [[right to vote]] was given to all men over 21 in [[South Australia]]. The other colonies soon followed. Women were given the vote in the [[Parliament of South Australia]] in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;aec.gov.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date=25 Oct. 2007 |accessdate=27 Jun. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8&lt;/ref&gt; 

Australians had started parliamentary democracries all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.

=== The Commonwealth of Australia ===
[[Image:Tom roberts big picture.jpg|thumb|300px|A painting of the opening of the first [[Parliament of Australia]], 9 May 1901, painted by [[Tom Roberts]]. Australia has had democracy since the 1850s.]]
[[File:Australian PR COB 2006.PNG|right|300px|thumb|Countries of birth of Australian estimated resident population, 2006.&lt;br /&gt;Source:Australian Bureau of Statistics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/E0A79B147EA8E0B5CA2572AC001813E8/$File/34120_2005-06.pdf Australian Bureau of Statistics], accessed 9 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Until 1901, Australia was not a [[nation]], it was six separate [[colony|colonies]] governed by Britain. They voted to join together to form one new country, called the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901. Australia was still part of the British Empire, and for at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia. But soon it had its own money, and its own Army and Navy. 

In Australia at this time, the [[trade union]]s were very strong, and they started a political party, the [[Australian Labor Party]]. Australia passed many laws to help the [[worker]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/wright.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain against [[Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Turkey]]. Australian soldiers were sent to [[Gallipoli]], in Turkey. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on [[ANZAC Day]]. They also fought on the [[Western Front]]. More than 60,000 Australians were killed. 

Australia had a really hard time in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against [[Nazi Germany]] when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]] by Japan. Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion. But with help from the [[United States Navy]], the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.

When the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people in Europe who had lost their homes in the war. It did things like build the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]]. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came from espcially from [[Italy]] and [[Greece]], other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like [[Turkey]] and [[Lebanon]]. An important new party, the [[Liberal Party (Australia)|Liberal Party of Australia]] was made by [[Robert Menzies]] in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972, then [[Gough Whitlam]] won for the Labor Party. Whitlam made changes, but he made the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] unhappy and the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] sacked him and forced an election in 1975. Then [[Malcolm Fraser]] won a few elections for the Liberal Party.

In the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]] and other countries in [[Asia]]. Australian became more [[multicultural]]. In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, helped by mining and wool. Australia started trading more with America, then Japan. Australia supported the United States in wars against [[dictatorship]]s in [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] and later [[Iraq]]. Australian soldiers also helped the [[United Nations]] in countries like [[East Timor]] in 1999. 

In 1973, the famous [[Sydney Opera House]] opened. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s lots of [[Australian cinema|Australian movies]], actors and [[Australian music|singers]] became famous around the world. In the year 2000, [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney had the Summer Olympics]]. 

In the 1980s and 90s, the Labor Party under [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]], then the Liberal Party under [[John Howard]] made lots of changes to the economy. Australia had a bad [[recession]] in 1991, but but when other Western countries [[Global financial crisis of September–October 2008|had trouble with their economies in 2008]], Australia stayed strong. 

Today Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has problems. Around 4-5% of Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like [[Uluru]]) has been returned to Aboriginal people, but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else. Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as [[immigrant]]s to live in  Australia. These people may come because they want to do business, or to live in a democracy, to join their family, or because they are [[refugee]]s. Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after [[World War Two]], including around 660,000 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Julia Gillard]] became the first woman [[Prime Minister of Australia]] in 2010 when she replaced her colleague [[Kevin Rudd]] of the Labor Party.

== Politics ==
[[File:Australian house of representatives04.jpg|thumb|left|The chamber of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in [[Canberra]].]]

Australia is made up of six [[state]]s and three mainland [[wikt:territory|territories]]. Each of state and territory has its own [[Parliament]] and makes its own local [[law]]s. The [[Parliament of Australia]] sits in Canberra and makes laws for the whole country, also known as the Commonwealth or [[Federation]]. 

The [[Federation|Federal]] government is led by the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], who is the member of Parliament chosen as leader. The current Prime Minister is [[Julia Gillard]], who replaced [[Kevin Rudd]], elected in June 2010. She is the leader of a [[political party]] called the [[Australian Labor Party]]. The other main party is the [[Liberal Party (Australia)|Liberal Party]]

The leader of Australia is the Prime Minister, although the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] represents the Queen of Australia, who is also the Queen of Great Britain, as head of state. The Governor-General, currently, Her Excellency Ms [[Quentin Bryce]], is chosen by the Prime Minister.

== Culture ==
[[File:Sydney Opera House Night.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The [[Sydney Opera House]] was officially opened in 1973.]]

Australia was [[Colonisation|colonised]] by people from [[Britain]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A New History of Australia |authors=Takao Fujikawa |year=2004 |publisher=ARMA |location=Tokyo |pages=pp. 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;,but today people from all over the world live there. English in the main spoken language, and Christianity is the main religion though all religions are accepted and not everybody has a religion. Australia is [[multiculturalism|multicultural]], which means that all its people are helped to keep their different languages, religions and ways of life, while also learning [[English language|English]] and joining in with other Australians. 

Famous [[Australian literature|Australian writers]] include the bush balladeers [[Banjo Paterson]] and [[Henry Lawson]] who wrote about life in the Australian bush. More modern famous writers include [[Peter Carey]], [[Thomas Keneally]] and [[Colleen McCullough]]. In 1973, [[Patrick White]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the only Australian to have achieved this; he is seen as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century.

[[Australian music]] has had lots of world-wide stars from the opera singers [[Nellie Melba]] and [[Joan Sutherland]], to the rock and roll bands [[Bee Gees]], [[AC/DC]] and [[INXS]], the folk-rocker [[Paul Kelly (musician)]], the pop singer [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Australian country music]] stars [[Slim Dusty]] and John Williamson. [[Australian Aboriginal music]] is very special and very ancient: it has the famous [[digeridoo]] woodwind instrument.

Australian TV has produced many successful programs for home and overseas - including [[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]], [[Home and Away]] and [[Neighbours]] - and produced such well known TV stars as [[Barry Humphries]] (''Dame Edna Everage''), [[Steve Irwin]] (''The Crocodile Hunter'') and [[The Wiggles]].
 
Australia has two public broadcasters (the ABC and the multi-cultural SBS), three commercial television networks, three pay TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, The Australian and The Australian Financial Review.

[[Australian cinema|Australian movies]] have a very long history. The world's first feature-film was the Australian movie ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' of 1906.&lt;ref&gt;http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1933, ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'', directed by Charles Chauvel, had [[Errol Flynn]] as the main actor.&lt;ref&gt;http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/wake-bounty/&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn went on to a celebrated career in Hollywood. The first Australian Oscar was won by 1942's ''[[Kokoda Front Line!]]'', directed by [[Ken G. Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/kokoda-front-line/&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s lots of big Australian movies and movie stars became world famous with films like ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'', [[Gallipoli (1981 film)|''Gallipoli'']] (with [[Mel Gibson]]), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man From Snowy River]]'' and ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/film/Croc.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Crowe]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Heath Ledger]] became global stars during the 1990s and ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'' starring [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Hugh Jackman]] made a lot of money in 2008.

=== Sport ===
[[File:DonaldBradman.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Don Bradman]].]]

Sport is an important part of Australian culture because the climate is good for outdoor activities. 23.5% Australians over the age of 15 regularly take part in organised sporting activities. In international sports, Australia has very strong teams in [[cricket]], [[hockey]], [[netball]], [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], and performs well in [[cycling]], [[rowing]] and swimming. Local popular sports include Australian rules football, horse racing, soccer and motor racing. Australia has participated in every summer [[Olympic Games]] since 1896, and every [[Commonwealth Games]]. Australia has hosted the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics]], and has ranked in the top five medal-winners since 2000. Australia has also hosted the 1938, 1962, 1982 and 2006 Commonwealth Games. Other major international events held regularly in Australia include the Australian Open, one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, annual international cricket matches and the Formula One Australian Grand Prix. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and elite athletes is common in Australia. Televised sport is popular; some of the highest rated television programs include the Summer Olympic Games and the grand finals of local and international football competitions. [[Australian Rules Football]] is also popular.

The main sporting leagues for males are [[AFL]], [[NRL]], [[A-League]] and [[NBL]]. 
For women, they are [[ANZ Netball Championships]], [[W-League]] and [[WNBL]].

The famous [[sports]] players who are Australian include the [[cricket]]er Sir [[Donald Bradman]], the [[swimming|swimmer]] [[Ian Thorpe]] and the [[athlete]] [[Cathy Freeman]].

=== Art festivals ===

Just 50 years ago, Australia had only one big Art festival. Now Australia has hundreds of smaller community-based festivals, and national and regional festivals that focus on specific art forms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/arts_festivals.html | title=Art festivals | author=Australian government | accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''American English''' or '''U.S. English''' is the [[dialect]] of [[English language]] spoken in the [[United States]]. It is different in some ways from other variations of English, such as [[British English]]. Historically, many types of American English can be found in old local dialects of England.

Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another form of English is spoken. This is partly because people hear and read American English via the [[media]], for example [[CNN]] television, and the [[Internet]], where the most common form of English is American English.

Because people all over the world hear and read American English as well as other versions of English we may find that the English language starts to take on (acquire) new words. English has been changing for centuries, adding new words to its [[vocabulary]]. For example, the English language spoken in [[India]], which has more than one billion people, will add more American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words adopted into English usage in India from from any of the 200+ Indian languages.

Sometimes people will learn American English as it is spoken in America - for example, in telephone call centers in India and other places, people often learn American English in order to sound more like their customers who call India from America. These people often continue to use American English in everyday life.

Many word definitions are different in '''American English'''. Most changes in a language start with small things like this - for instance [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] all came from [[Latin]] due to many small changes in use over centuries.

==Spelling in American English==
There are many words that sound the same between the American English and British English, but are spelled differently.  For example:

*Words originally from the French that end in &quot;-our&quot; in British English (behaviour, colour, honour, neighbour, etc.) end in &quot;-or&quot; in American English (behavior, color, honor, neighbor)
*Some words that end in -re in British English (metre, centre) end in -er in American English
*Verbs that end in -ise in British English (criticise, realise) end in -ize in American English (criticize, organize, realize) Many of these differences can be traced to the works of Anglophobe Noah Webster, who produced the American dictionary following the War of Independence.

Some more differences in American English:
* aluminium is spelled &quot;aluminum&quot;
* doughnut is spelled &quot;donut&quot;
* draught is spelled &quot;draft&quot;
* gaol (not common) is spelled &quot;jail&quot;
* plough is spelled &quot;plow&quot;

There are also some words in American English that are a bit different from British English, e.g.:
* aeroplane is called &quot;airplane&quot;
* ladybird is called &quot;ladybug&quot;
* lift is called &quot;elevator&quot;
* loo is called &quot;bathroom&quot; or &quot;restroom&quot;
* lorry is called &quot;truck&quot;
* nappies are called &quot;diapers&quot;
* petrol is called &quot;gas&quot; (or &quot;gasoline&quot;)
* trousers are called &quot;pants&quot;
* underground is called &quot;subway&quot;
* braces are &quot;suspenders&quot; - &quot;suspenders&quot; in British-English refers to items of apparel worn around the lower leg by males to prevent socks/sox from sagging, and around the upper leg by women wearing stockings.

'''Aquaculture''' is the [[farming]] of [[fish]], [[shrimp]], and [[algae]]. Aquaculture supplies fish (such as catfish, salmon, and trout, shrimp, and algae). Aquaculture was developed a long time ago in [[China]] and aquaculture supplies for over 20% of all the seafood harvested. However aquaculture is quite a new activity in [[Canada]] as it only began in the [[1879]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''abbreviation''' is a shorter way to write a word or phrase. People use abbreviations for words that they write a lot. The [[English language]] occasionally uses the [[apostrophe]] mark ' to show that a word is written in a shorter way, but some abbreviations do not use this mark. More often, they use periods, especially the ones that come from the [[Latin]] language. Common Latin abbreviations include '''i.e.''' [id est] ''that is'', '''e.g.''' [exempli gratia] ''for example'', and '''et al.''' [et alia] ''and others''.

Some new abbreviations have been created by [[scientist]]s, by workers in companies and governments, and by people using the [[Internet]]. 

People often think words are abbreviations when in fact they are [[acronym]]s.

Here are examples of common acronyms: The word &quot;[[radar]]&quot; is an [[acronym]] for &quot;Radio Detection and Ranging&quot;. The name of the large computer company [[IBM]] comes from the words &quot;International Business Machines&quot;. The name of the part of the [[United States]] government that sends [[rocket]]s into [[outer space]] is NASA, from the words &quot;National Aeronautics and Space Administration&quot;. When people using the Internet think that something is very funny, they sometimes write &quot;LOL&quot; to mean &quot;Laughing Out Loud&quot;. People sometimes write &quot;ASAP&quot; for &quot;As Soon As Possible&quot;.

In many [[religion]]s, an '''angel''' is a good [[spirit]]. The word angel comes from the Greek word ''angelos'' which means &quot;messenger&quot;. Angels appear frequently in the [[Old Testament]], the [[New Testament]], and the [[Qur'an]]. In all of these, angels appear like humans.  In Christianity angels are helpers of god who are ministers to the faithful. 

Angels do not have the ability to sin.

In the Bible angels often punished peoples for their sins. They tested people's faith in God.
They are often depicted in art as having wings and a halo. The wings represent their speed, and the halo represents their holiness. Angels named in the Bible are [[Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] and Raphael.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ad hominem''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] term. It is used in [[rhetoric]]. Rhetoric is the science of how to speak well, and how to convince other people of your [[idea]]s. 

Translated to English, ''ad hominem'' means ''against the person'' (Latin ''homo'', where ''hominem'' is a form is [[gender]]-neutral. In ancient [[Rome]] it referred to all free men, and by extension to all free human beings). 

The term is used to describe a rhetorical argument, that is directed towards the person who says something, not about the cause at hand. It is a way to use [[reputation]] and [[wikt:rumour|rumour]] and [[hearsay]] to change minds.

When a [[social network]] has already excluded or exiled one person, or applied a [[label]] to them, this works more often.

Because it works and is also [[unfair]] to everyone who would benefit from [[what]] they say, it is considered to be a weak or poor argument. [[Formal disapproval]] of those who use it is common in a [[court]] or in [[diplomacy]], where [[wikt:danger|danger]] is high.

== What an ad hominem argument looks like ==
In [[logic]], a [[wikt:proof|proof]] is something that starts with [[premise]]s, and goes through a few logical [[argument]]s, to reach a [[conclusion]].

=== Normal (valid) proof ===
# All [[human]]s are mortal
# [[Socrates]] is a man (he is human)
# Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

=== Ad hominem example ===
# Person A thinks [[abortion]] should be [[illegal]]
# Person A is uneducated and poor
# Therefore abortion should not be illegal.

In this example it can be seen that the (completely unrelated) fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal.

'''Native Americans''' (also '''Aboriginal People''', '''Aboriginal Americans''', '''American Indians''', '''Amerindians''', '''Amerind''', '''Indians''', '''First Nations''', '''First Peoples''', '''Alaskan Natives''', '''Native Canadians''', or '''Indigenous Peoples of America''') are the people who were in [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean]] Islands when Europeans arrived. 
[[Christopher Columbus]] was travelling west, so he thought he was going to [[India]]. This is why he called the people &quot;Indians&quot;. There are more than three million Native Americans in Canada and the U.S. combined.

Sometimes these people are called &quot;[[Indian]]s&quot;, but this is confusing, because it is the same word used for people from [[India]]. The words [[aboriginal]] or [[first people]] or [[indigenous]] people are also used. Other names for these for Native Americans are [[First Nations]] (in [[Canada]]) and &quot;Red Indians&quot; (this is not used much any more). There are many different [[tribe]]s of American Indian people, with many different languages. 

Many American Indians died after the Europeans came to the Americas, from [[disease]]s that came with the Europeans that were new to the Indians, in [[war]]s with the Europeans, or because the Europeans made them work as [[slave]]s. Most of the American Indians were hurt or killed by settlers who wanted to take their lands. 

Most people think that the ancestors of American Indians came to the Americas from [[Asia]]. Some of them may have come to America over 12,000 years ago when [[Alaska]] was connected to Asia by land. Some people think that they came to the Americas even before that. Some of their ancestors may have come along the coastline in small boats or canoes, because sometimes there were glaciers blocking the land between Alaska and Asia. 

Some Indian tribes and languages of North America are [[Cherokee]], [[Maya]] or [[Yucatec Maya]], [[Aztecs]], [[Navajo]], and [[Sioux]]. 

Some Indian tribes and languages of South America are [[Aymara]], [[Guarani]], [[Quechua]], and [[Tupi]].

The '''apple''' is a [[Fleshy fruits#Pome|pomaceous]] [[fruit]] from the apple [[tree]]. It is in the [[species]] ''Malus domestica'' in the [[rose]] family [[Rosaceae]]. The apple is one of most [[tillage|cultivated]] of tree fruits.

The tree came from [[Central Asia]]. Its wild ancestor is still there today. There are more than 7,500 kinds of different apple trees.&lt;ref name=England/&gt;

At least 55&amp;nbsp;million [[ton]]s of apples were grown around in the world in 2005. All together, they cost about $10&amp;nbsp;billion. [[People's Republic of China|China]] produced about 35% of the world's apples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple&quot;/&gt; The [[United States]] produces more than 7.5% of the apples around the world. This makes it the second greatest producer. [[Iran]] is third, after which comes [[Turkey]], [[Russia]], [[Italy]] and [[India]].

== Botanical information ==

The apple has a small, [[deciduous]] tree that grows up to {{convert|3|to|12|m|ft}} tall. The apple tree has a broad crown with thick [[twig]]s.
The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[Phyllotaxis|alternately arranged]] simple [[oval]]s. They are 5 to 12&amp;nbsp;[[centimeter|cm]] long and {{convert|3|-|6|cm|in}} wide. It has a sharp top with a soft underside. [[Blossom]]s come out in [[spring]] at the same time that the leaves begin to bud. The [[flower]]s are white. They also have a slightly pink color. They are five [[petal]]ed, and {{convert|2.5|to|3.5|cm|in}} in [[wikt:diameter|diameter]]. The fruit [[wikt:maturity|matures]] in [[autumn]]. It is usually {{convert|5|to|9|cm|in}} diameter. There are five [[carpel]]s arranged in a [[star]] in the middle of the fruit. Every carpel has one to three [[seed]]s.

=== Wild ancestors ===
The wild [[ancestor]]s of ''Malus domestica'' are ''Malus sieversii''. They grow wild in the [[mountain]]s of [[Central Asia]] in the south of [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Xinjiang]], [[People's Republic of China|China]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Architecture and size relations: an essay on the apple (Malus x domestica, Rosaceae) tree&quot;/&gt; and possibly also ''Malus sylvestris''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coart&quot;/&gt; Unlike [[wikt:domestication|domesticated]] apples, their leaves become red in autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Archetti M.

==History==

The apple tree was possibly the earliest tree to be cultivated.&lt;ref name=app6/&gt; Its fruits have become better over thousands of years. It is said that [[Alexander the Great]] discovered [[wikt:small|dwarfed]] apples in [[Asia Minor]] in 300 [[BCE]]. [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] have used winter apples as an important food for thousands of years. From when [[Europe]]ans arrived, [[Argentina]] and the [[United States]] have used apples as food as well.&lt;ref name=app6&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.vegparadise.com/highestperch39.html
|title= An apple a day keeps the doctor away
|accessdate= 27 January 2008
|publisher=vegparadise.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apples were brought to [[North America]] in the 1600s. The first apple [[orchard]] on the North American continent was said to be near [[Boston]] in 1625. In the 1900s, costly fruit [[industry|industries]], where the apple was a very important species, began developing.&lt;ref name=app3/&gt;

== In culture ==

=== Germanic paganism ===
[[Image:Carl Larsson Brita as Iduna.jpg|thumb|&quot;Brita as [[Iðunn|Iduna]]&quot; (1901) by Carl Larsson]]

In [[Norse mythology]], the goddess [[Iðunn]] gives apples to the gods in ''Prose Edda'' (written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]) that makes them young forever. English [[wikt:scholar|scholar]] H. R. Ellis Davidson suggests that apples were related to [[religion|religious]] practices in [[Germanic paganism]]. It was from there, she claims, that [[Norse paganism]] developed. She points out that buckets of apples were discovered in the place of burial for the Oseberg [[ship]] in [[Norway]]. She also remarks that fruit and [[nut]]s (Iðunn having been described as changing into a nut in ''Skáldskaparmál'') have been discovered in the early [[grave]]s of the [[Germanic peoples]] in [[England]]. They have also been discovered somewhere else on the continent of Europe. She suggests that this may have had a [[symbol]]ic meaning. Nuts are still a symbol of [[fertility]] in Southwest England.

Sometimes apples are eaten after they are [[cooked]]. Often apples are eaten uncooked. Apples can also be made into [[drink]]s. [[Apple juice]] and apple [[cider]] are apple drinks. 

The flesh of the fruit is firm with a taste anywhere from sour to sweet. Apples used for cooking are sour, and need to be cooked with sugar, while other apples are sweet, and do not need cooking. There are some seeds at the core, that can be removed with a [[tool]] that removes the core, or by carefully using a [[knife]].

The [[scientific name]] of the apple tree genus in the [[Latin]] language is ''Malus''. Most apples that people grow are of the ''Malus domestica'' species.

Most apples are good to eat [[raw]] (not cooked), and are also used in many kinds of [[bake]]d foods, such as [[apple pie]]. Apples are cooked until they are [[wikt:soft|soft]] to make [[apple sauce]].

Apples are also made into the [[drink]]s [[apple juice]] and [[cider]]. Usually, cider contains a little [[alcohol]], about as much as [[beer]]. The regions of [[Brittany]] in [[France]] and [[Cornwall]] in [[England]] are known for their apple ciders.

If one wants to grow a certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting a seed from the wanted type. The seed will have [[DNA]] from the apple that the seeds came from, but it will also  have DNA from the apple flower that [[pollinate]]d the seeds, which may well be a different type. This means that the tree which would grow from planting would be a mixture of two. In order to grow a certain type of apple, a small twig, or 'scion', is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired, and then added on to a specially grown [[stump]] called a rootstock. The tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed.

== Apple cultivars ==

There are more than 7,500 known [[cultivar]]s of apples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elzebroek&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Elzebroek|first=A.T.G.|coauthors=Wind, K.|title=Guide to Cultivated Plants|publisher=CAB International|location=Wallingford|date=2008|page=27|isbn=1845933567|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YvU1XnUVxFQC&amp;lpg=PT39&amp;dq=apple%20cultivars%207%2C500&amp;pg=PT39#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different cultivars are available for [[temperate]] and [[subtropical]] climates.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; apple cultivars is at the National Fruit Collection in [[England]]. Most of these cultivars are grown for eating fresh (dessert apples). However, some are grown simply for cooking or making [[cider]]. Cider apples are usually too [[wikt:tart|tart]] to eat immediately. However, they give cider a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.&lt;ref name=&quot;apples1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Most popular apple cultivars are soft but [[wikt:crisp|crisp]]. Colorful skin, easy shipping, disease resistance, '[[Red Delicious]]' apple shape, and popular flavor are also needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;England&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern apples are usually sweeter than older cultivars. This is because popular tastes in apples have become different. Most [[North America]]ns and [[Europe]]ans enjoy sweet apples.&lt;ref name=World/&gt; Extremely sweet apples with hardly any acid taste are popular in [[Asia]]&lt;ref name=World&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and India.&lt;ref name=apples1/&gt;

== In the United Kingdom ==
In the [[United Kingdom]] there are about 3000 different types of apples. The most common apple type grown in England is the 'Bramley seedling', which is a popular cooking apple.

Apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early 1900s, when apples were rarely brought in from other countries. Organizations such as [http://www.commonground.org.uk/ Common Ground] teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit. '[[Apple Day]]' is celebrated each [[October 21]] in many countries.

== In North America ==
Many apples are grown in [[temperate]] parts of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. In many areas where apple growing is important, people have huge celebrations:
* [[Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival]] - held six days every spring in [[Winchester, Virginia]].
* [[Annapolis Valley Apple Blossom Festival]] - held five days every spring (May-June) in [[Nova Scotia]].
* [[Washington State Apple Blossom Festival]] - held two weeks every spring (April-May) in [[Wenatchee, Washington]].

== Varieties of apples ==
[[File:Golden delicious apple.jpg|right|thumb|A Golden Delicious apple.]]
There are lots of different varieties of apples, including:
* [[Granny Smith]]
* [[Pink Lady]]
* [[Golden Delicious]] (some times called a Green Delicious Apple)
* [[Gala]]
* [[Red Delicious]]
* [[McIntosh]]
* [[Winesap]]
* [[Fuji]]
* [[Jonagold]]

== Family ==
Apples are in the group [[Maloideae]]. It is a subfamily of the family ''[[Rosaceae]]''. They are in the same subfamily as [[Pear|pears]]. Its family is the family of rose like plants, and roses are in the family.

      <text xml:space="preserve">People use the term '''Abrahamic religion''' for a number of [[religion]]s that recognise [[Abraham]] as an important person. The best known and probably most popular Abrahamic religions are [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].
Another world Abrahamic religion is the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. The Bahá'í faith originated in the [[19th century]], in what is known today as [[Iran]].&lt;br/&gt;

Even though these religions are quite different from each other in many ways, they also agree in many other very important ways on the basic general nature of the one [[God]] whom they worship. 

The word &quot;Abrahamic&quot; refers to the ancient [[prophet]] [[Abraham]], who is respected in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as the first prophet of God.

Another thing Abrahamic religions have in common is that they are &quot;[[monotheism|Monotheistic]]&quot; (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words for &quot;one&quot; and &quot;God&quot;), meaning belief in just one God.

They also all believe that people should pray to this God often.

'''Algebra''' is a part of [[mathematics]] (frequently just called math or maths). It is used to find values and [[variable]]s that make [[equation]]s and [[inequality|inequalities]] true. It often needs knowledge of the rules of [[number]]s and mathematics [[operation_(mathematics)|operation]]s used on numbers ([[addition|adding]], [[subtraction|subtracting]], [[multiplication|multiplying]], [[division_(mathematics)|dividing]], and other operations). Algebra uses [[letter]]s (''a'',''b'',''c'',...) and other symbols to represent numbers. The letters and symbols in algebra are called [[variable]]s. We use variables because the numbers are [[unknown (math)|unknown]] or can change.

Algebra was first used to [[solution_(mathematics)|solve]] equations. Two examples are [[linear equation]]s and [[quadratic equation]]s.

The ways developed to solve equations frequently made use of the facts of the parts of an equation. For example, how to [[factorization|factorize]] [[polynomial]]s, or how to use a [[matrix_(mathematics)|matrix]] to solve many linear equations at once. ''[[Abstract algebra]]'' is the study of things that are found in equations. For example, polynomials and matrices. These things are known as algebraic structures. Understanding the properties of more complex [[algebraic structure]]s can help us solve more complex equations.

Of particular importance to the study of algebra is the study of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], since functions often appear in equations that we are trying to solve. A function is like a box you can put a number or numbers into and get a certain number out. When a function takes one variable in, like f(x), it is called a univariate function. When a function takes many variables in, like Q(x,y,z), it is called a multivariate function. 

The study of algebra is heavily concerned with the subject of graphing functions, as [[graph]]s can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations. 

In some math problems one variable is changed. The variable that is changed is called the &quot;independent&quot; variable. After the variable is changed the math operations in the equation are performed to make a number. The number that is made is called the &quot;dependent&quot; variable. Most of the time the independent variable is written as ''x'' and the dependent variable is written as ''y'', for example, in ''y'' = 3''x'' + 1. This is because we do not know what number they are until we are told.

Many math problems are about physics. In many of these physics problems time is a variable. Time is written ''t''. Using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce a math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems. Algebra is taught in school to help in harder mathematics, [[science]], and [[engineering]] classes.

Here is a simple example of an algebra problem:

:Sue has 12 jellybeans, Ann has 24 jellybeans. They decide to share so that they have the same number of jellybeans. Let ''x'' represent the number of jellybeans Ann gives to Sue. Then we want 12 + ''x'' = 24 - ''x''. 

Here are steps you can use to solve the problem:

# Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation. This gives ''x'' = 12 - ''x''.
# Add ''x'' to both sides of the equation. This gives 2''x'' = 12. 
# Divide both sides of the equation by 2. This gives ''x'' = 6. If Ann gives Sue 6 jellybeans, they will have the same number of jellybeans.

This problem could be solved without algebra. The purpose of simple story problems such as this one is to teach algebra. Once a student is comfortable with simple problems like this, it is easier to try harder ones. With practice, the students can use algebra when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way. Problems such as building a freeway, designing a cell phone, or finding the cure for a disease all require algebra.

In addition to &quot;[[elementary algebra]]&quot;, or basic algebra, there are advanced forms of algebra, taught in colleges and universities, such as [[abstract algebra]], [[linear algebra]], and [[universal algebra]]. With abstract algebra and universal algebra, it is hard to see how studying them helps solve problems, but with linear algebra it is much clearer.

Algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things.

== Writing algebra ==
In algebra, adding ''z'' to ''y'' (or ''y'' plus ''z'') is written as &lt;tt&gt;y + z&lt;/tt&gt;.
Subtracting ''z'' from ''y'' (or ''y'' minus ''z'') is written as &lt;tt&gt;y − z&lt;/tt&gt;.

In algebra, multiplying ''y'' by ''z'' (or ''y'' times ''z'') can be written in 4 ways: &lt;tt&gt;y × z&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;y*z&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;y·z&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;yz&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;yz&lt;/tt&gt; is the most usual form of writing the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of ''y'' and ''z'' in algebra.

When we multiply a number and a letter in algebra, we write the number in front of the letter: &lt;tt&gt;5 × y = 5y&lt;/tt&gt;. When the number is 1, then the 1 is not written because 1 times any number is that number (1 × ''y'' = ''y'') and so is not needed.

When we multiply two numbers in algebra, the only way is usually &lt;tt&gt;3·4&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;3(4)&lt;/tt&gt; can also be used. The symbol &quot;×&quot; is not used, because it looks too much like the letter x.

In algebra, dividing ''y'' by ''z'' (or ''y'' over ''z'') is written as &lt;tt&gt;y ÷ z&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;y/z&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;y/z&lt;/tt&gt; is more commonly used.

== Graphing algebra ==
Algebra also introduces graphing, or drawing a picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation true. Usually this is easy to do when there are only one or two variables. The graph is often a line, and if the line does not bend or go straight up-and-down it can be described by the basic formula &lt;math&gt;y = mx + b&lt;/math&gt; where ''b'' is the [[y-intercept]] of the graph and ''m'' is the [[slope]]. This formula applies to the coordinates of the graph or &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;.
There may be linear or simultaneous equations of algebra.
Eg. A '''linear''' graph is drawn, equations stating ''x=ky'' is to be drawn on the graph line.This is called inverse or direct proportion. Inverse proportion=Downwards sloping line,Direct proportion=Upwards sloping line with a circle at the origin.

== History ==
The word &quot;algebra&quot; is a [[Latin language|Latin]] form of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''Al-Jabr'' (&quot;casting&quot;) and comes from a mathematics book ''Al-Maqala fi Hisab-al Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah'', (&quot;Essay on the Computation of Casting and Equation&quot;) written in the [[9th century]] by a famous [[Iran|Persian]] mathematician, [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]], who was a [[Islam|Muslim]] born in [[Khwarizm]] in [[Uzbekistan]]. He flourished under Al-Ma'moun in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] through 813-833 CE, and died around 840 CE. The book was brought into [[Europe]] and [[translation|translated]] into Latin in the [[12th century]]. The book was then given the name 'Algebra'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''As''' is a word used to [[compare]] the [[similar]]ities of two ideas.  Like &quot;[[like]]&quot;, it is a [[simile]].  But '''as''' is more often used in [[idiom]]s specific to English:

*&quot;Green as grass&quot;
*&quot;Right as rain&quot;

Usually, one idea is more [[abstract]] and the other is more [[concrete]] - and &quot;as&quot; is intended to be more general than just one situation. 

*&quot;Love as war&quot;
*&quot;Time as a path&quot;

In other words, you can say more generally what an [[idiom]] or [[metaphor]] says:  for example, &quot;[[battle of the sexes]]&quot; is both a [[metaphor]] and an [[idiom]] that suggests &quot;love as war&quot;.

Because of this power, you can state an idiom or metaphor in a way that makes it clear what it means, and what it might assume.

An '''atom''' is a basic unit that makes up all [[matter]]. There are many different types of atom each with its own name, [[mass]] and size. These are called [[chemical element]]s, such as [[hydrogen]] or [[gold]]. Atoms are very small; the exact size changes depending on the element: they range from 0.1 to 0.5 [[nanometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/MichaelPhillip.shtml|title=Size of an Atom}}&lt;/ref&gt; One nanometer is around a hundred times smaller than the width of a human [[hair]]. This makes atoms almost impossible to see. The way they work, and how they act with other atoms has to be seen using [[equation]]s. 

Atoms combine to make [[molecule]]s or particles: for example, two hydrogen atoms and one [[oxygen]] atom combine to make a [[water]] molecule, a form of a [[chemical]] reaction. 

Atoms themselves are made up of three kinds of smaller particles, called [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s and [[electron]]s. The protons and neutrons are in the middle of the atom. They are called the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. The nucleus is surrounded by a cloud of electrons with a negative [[charge]] which are bound to the nucleus by an [[electromagnetic]] force. 

Protons and neutrons are made up of even smaller particles called [[quark]]s. Electrons are [[elementary particle|elementary or fundamental particles]]; they cannot be split into smaller parts. 

The number of protons, neutrons and electrons an atom has determines what element it is. Hydrogen, for example, has one proton, no neutrons and one electron;  the element [[sulfur]] has 16 protons, 16 neutrons and 16 electrons.

Atoms move faster when in gas form (as they are free to move) than liquid and solid matter. In solid [[wikt:material|materials]] the atoms are tightly next to each other so they {{broken wikt link|vibrate|vibrate}}, but are not able to move (there is no room) as atoms in liquids do.

== History ==
The word &quot;atom&quot; comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀτόμος, ''{{broken wikt link|indivisible|indivisible}}'', from ἀ-, ''not,'' and τόμος, ''a cut.'' The first historical mention of the word atom came from works by the Greek [[philosophy|philosopher]] Democritus, around 400BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.winneconne.k12.wi.us/ms_teachers/LENZ/history_of_atomic_theory.htm|title=History of Atomic Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atomic theory stayed as a mostly [[philosophy|philosophical]] subject, with not much actual scientific investigation or study, until the development of [[chemistry]] in the 1600s. In 1777 [[France|French]] chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] defined the term ''element'' for the first time. He said that an [[chemical element|element]] was any basic substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry. Any substance that could be broken down was a ''[[Chemical compound|compound]]''.&lt;ref name=Brief&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.cerritos.edu/ladkins/a106/a%20brief%20history%20of%20the%20atom.htm|title=A Brief History of the Atom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803 [[England|English]] philosopher John Dalton suggested that elements were tiny, solid spheres made of atoms. Dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass. He said that compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine. According to Dalton, in a compound, atoms of different elements always combine the same way.

In 1827 British scientist Robert Brown looked at [[pollen]] grains in water and used Dalton's atomic theory to describe patterns in the way they moved.  This was called ''Brownian Motion''. In 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] used mathematics to prove that the seemingly random movements were down to the reactions of atoms, and by doing so he conclusively proved the existence of the atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_95/journal/vol4/ykl/report.html|title=Brownian motion - a history}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1869 scientist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] published the first version of the [[periodic table]]. The periodic table groups atoms by their [[atomic number]] (how many [[proton]]s they have. This is always the same as the number of [[electron]]s). 
Elements in the same column, or period, usually have similar properties. For example [[helium]], [[neon]], [[argon]], [[krypton]] and [[xenon]] are all in the same column and have very similar properties. All these elements are [[gas]]es that have no colour and no smell. Together they are known as the [[noble gas]]es.&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt;

The physicist [[J.J. Thomson]] was the first man to discover electrons, while he was working with [[cathode ray]]s in 1897. He realized they had a negative [[electrical charge|charge]], unlike protons (positive) and neutrons (no charge). Thomson created the [[plum pudding model]], which stated that an atom was like plum pudding: the dried fruit (electrons) were stuck in a mass of pudding (protons). In 1909 a scientist named [[Ernest Rutherford]] used the [[Geiger–Marsden experiment]] to prove that most of an atom is in a very small space called the [[atomic nucleus]]. Rutherford took a photo plate and surrounded it with gold foil, and then shot alpha particles at it. Many of the particles went through the gold foil, which proved that atoms are mostly empty space. Electrons are so small they make up only 1% of an atom's [[mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://ion.elte.hu/~akos/orak/atfsz/atom/rutherford_atom11.pdf|title=Ernest Rutherford on Nuclear spin and Alpha Particle interaction.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Ernest Rutherford.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ernest Rutherford in  1910, shortly before he won the [[Nobel Prize]] for [[physics]].]]

In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] introduced the [[Bohr model]]. This model showed that electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed circular orbits. This was more accurate than the Rutherford model. However, it was still not completely right. Improvements to the Bohr model have been made since it was first introduced.

In 1925 chemist [[Frederick Soddy]] found that some elements in the periodic table had more than one kind of atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1921/soddy-bio.html|title=Frederick Soddy, the Nobel Prize in chemistry: 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For example any atom with 2 protons should be a [[helium]] atom. Usually, a helium [[nucleus]] also contains two neutrons. However, some helium atoms have only one neutron. This means they are still helium, as the element is defined by the number of protons, but they are not normal helium either. Soddy called an atom like this, with a different number of neutrons, an ''[[isotope]]''. To get the name of the isotope we look at how many protons and neutrons it has in its [[nucleus]] and add this to the name of the element. So a helium atom with two protons and one neutron is called helium-3, and a carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons is called carbon-12. However, when he developed his theory Soddy could not be certain neutrons actually existed. To prove they were real physicist James Chadwick and a team of others created the [[mass spectrometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1935/chadwick-lecture.html|title=James Chadwick: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1935, a lecture on the Neutron and its properties}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mass spectrometer actually measures the mass and weight of individual atoms. By doing this Chadwick proved that to account for all the weight of the atom, neutrons must exist. 

In 1937 [[Germany|German]] chemist [[Otto Hahn]] became the first person to create [[nuclear fission]] in a laboratory. He discovered this by chance when he was shooting neutrons at a [[uranium]] atom, hoping to create a new isotope.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/classroom/chemach/atomic/hahn-meitner.html|title=Otto Hahn, Liese Meitner and Fritz Strassman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he noticed that instead of a new isotope the uranium simply changed into a [[barium]] atom. This was the world's first recorded nuclear fission reaction. This discovery eventually led to the creation of the [[atomic bomb]]. 

Further into the 20th century physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom. Using particle accelerators they discovered that protons and neutrons were actually made of other particles, called [[quarks]].

The most accurate model so far comes from the [[Schrödinger equation]]. Schrödinger realized that the electrons exist in a cloud around the nucleus, called the [[electron cloud]]. In the electron cloud, it is impossible to know exactly where electrons are. The Schrödinger equation is used to find out where an electron is likely to be found. This area is called the electron's [[atomic orbital|orbital]].

== Structure and parts ==
=== Parts ===

The atom is made up of three main particles; the [[proton]], the [[neutron]] and the [[electron]]. The [[isotope]] of [[Hydrogen]] Hydrogen-1 has no neutrons, and a positive hydrogen [[ion]] has no electrons. These are the only known exceptions, all other atoms have at least one proton, neutron and electron each. 

Electrons are by far the smallest of the three, their mass and size is too small to be measured using current technology.&lt;ref name=park&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://sciencepark.etacude.com/particle/structure.php|title=Particle Physics - Structure of a Matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a negative [[Electrical charge|charge]]. Protons and neutrons are similar sizes&lt;ref name=park /&gt; Protons are positively charged and neutrons have no charge. 
Most atoms have a neutral charge; because the number of protons (positive) and electrons (negative) are the same, the charges balance out to zero. However in [[ion]]s (different number of electrons) this is not always the case and they can have a positive or a negative charge. Protons and Neutrons are made out of [[quark]]s, of two types; up quarks and down quarks. A proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark and a neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark.

=== Nucleus ===
The nucleus is in the middle of an atom. It is made up of protons and neutrons. Usually in nature two things with the same charge repel or shoot away from each other. So for a long time it was a mystery to scientists how the positively charged protons in the nucleus stayed together. They solved this by finding a particle called a [[Gluon]]. Its name comes from the word ''[[glue]]'' as Gluons act like atomic glue, sticking the protons together using the ''strong nuclear force''.  It is this force which also holds the quarks together that make up the protons and neutrons.

[[File:Nuclear fusion forces diagram.svg|thumb|left|250px|A diagram showing the main difficulty in [[nuclear fusion]], the fact that protons, which have positive charges, repel each other when forced together.]]

The number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus is stable or goes through [[radioactive decay]]. When there are too many neutrons or protons, the atom tries to make the numbers the same by getting rid of the extra particles. It does this by emitting radiation in the form of [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]] or [[gamma ray|gamma]] decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/quantskills/methods/quantlit/RadDecay.html|title=How does radioactive decay work?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclei can change through other means too. [[Nuclear fission]] is when the Nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing a lot of stored [[energy]]. This release energy is what makes nuclear fission useful for making [[bomb]]s and [[electricity]], in the form of [[nuclear power]]. 
The other way nuclei can change is through [[nuclear fusion]], when two nuclei join together, or fuse, to make a heavier nucleus. This process requires extreme amounts of energy in order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons, as they have the same charge. Such high energies are most commonly found in [[star]]s like our [[Sun]], which fuses hydrogen for fuel.

=== Electrons ===
{{main|Electron}}

Electrons orbit or go around the nucleus. They are called the atom's ''electron cloud''. They are attracted towards the nucleus because of the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]]. Electrons have a negative charge and the nucleus always has a positive charge, so they attract each other. 
Around the nucleus some electrons are further out than others. These are called ''electron shells''. In most atoms the first shell has two electrons, and all after that have eight. Exceptions are rare, but they do happen and are difficult to predict.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.chemtutor.com/struct.htm#str|title=Chemtutor on atomic structure}}&lt;/ref&gt; The further away the electron is from the nucleus, the weaker the pull of the nucleus on it. This is why bigger atoms, with more electrons, react more easily with other atoms.
The electromagnetism of the nucleus is not enough to hold onto their electrons and they lose them to the strong attraction of smaller atoms &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sciencebyjones.com/chemical_reactivity.htm|title=Chemical reactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radioactive decay ==
{{main|Radioactive decay}}

Some elements, and many isotopes, have what is called an ''unstable nucleus''. This means the nucleus is either too big to hold itself together&lt;ref name=Splung&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.splung.com/content/sid/5/page/radioactivity|title=Radioactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt; or has too many protons, electrons or neutrons. When this happens the nucleus has to get rid of the excess mass or particles. It does this through [[radiation]]. An atom that does this can be called ''radioactive''. Unstable atoms continue to be radioactive until they lose enough mass/particles that they become stable. All atoms above atomic number 82 (82 protons) are radioactive.&lt;ref name=Splung /&gt;

There are three main types of radioactive decay; [[alpha decay|alpha]], [[beta decay|beta]] and [[gamma ray|gamma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/gcse/physics/radioactivity/types-of-radiation.html|title=S-Cool: Types of radiation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Alpha decay]] is when the atom shoots out two protons and two neutrons. This is essentially a Helium nucleus. The result is an element with atomic number two less than before. So for example if a [[Beryllium]] atom (atomic number 4) went through alpha decay it would become [[Helium]] (atomic number 2). Alpha decay happens when an atom is too big and needs to get rid of some mass. 

* [[Beta decay]] is when a neutron turns into a proton or a proton turns into a neutron. In the first case the atom shoots out an electron, in the second case it is a [[positron]] (like an electron but with a positive charge). The end result is an element with one higher or one lower atomic number than before. Beta decay happens when an atom has either too many protons, or too many neutrons. 

* [[Gamma ray|Gamma decay]] is when an atom shoots out a [[gamma ray]], or wave.  It happens when there is a change in the [[energy]] of the nucleus. This is usually after a nucleus has already gone through alpha or beta decay. There is no change in the mass, or atomic number or the atom, only in the stored energy inside the nucleus.

Every radioactive element or isotope has something called a ''half life''. This is how long it takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay until they become a different stable isotope or element.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/isotopes/radioactive_decay3.html|title=What is half-life?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large atoms, or isotopes with a big difference between the number of protons and neutrons will therefore have a long half life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Astronomy''' is the study of [[outer space]] and everything in it. This includes [[star]]s, [[planet]]s and [[galaxies]] as well as other things. The word astronomy comes from the Greek words ''astron'' which means [[star]] and ''nomos'' which means [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=astronomy|title=Astronomy - and etymology|accessdate=2008-11-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who studies astronomy is called an '''astronomer'''.

Astronomy is one of the oldest [[science]]s. Ancient people used the positions of the stars to {{broken wikt link|navigation|navigate}}, and to find when was the best time to plant [[crops]]. Astronomy is very similar to [[astrophysics]]. Since the 20th century there have been two main types of astronomy, ''Observational'' and ''Theoretical'' astronomy. Observational astronomy uses [[telescope]]s and [[camera]]s to ''[[wikt:observe|observe]]'' or look at stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects. Theoretical astronomy uses [[maths]] and [[computer model]]s to predict what should happen. The two often work together, the theoretical predicts what should happen and the observational shows whether the prediction works. 

Astronomy is not the same as ''[[astrology]]'', the belief that the patterns the stars and the planets make affect [[human]] lives. 

== History of Astronomy ==

==== Ancient ====
Early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars. They used [[map]]s of the stars for religious reasons and also to work out the time of year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=17322&amp;pageno=5|title=An online book - Gutenberg history of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early civilizations such as the [[Maya]] people and the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians built simple [[observatory|observatories]] and drew maps of the stars positions. They also began to think about the place of [[Earth]] in the [[universe]]. For a long time people thought [[Earth]] was the center of the universe, and that the planets, the stars and the sun went around it. This is known as the ''geocentric'' model of [[the Universe]]. 

Arabic astronomers made many advancements during the [[Middle Ages]] including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/1612/medieval.html|title=A brief history of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Copernicus, Galileo and the Heliocentric Model ====
[[File:Galileo moon phases.jpg|thumb|portrait|right|150px|Some drawings of [[the Moon]] by Galileo. His drawings were more detailed than anyone before him because he used a telescope to look a the Moon.]]
During the [[renaissance]] an astronomer named [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] thought of a new idea. He thought, from looking at the way the planets moved, that the Earth was not the center of the Solar System. He said, and he was right, that the Sun was at the centre of the Solar System and all the planets including Earth moved around it. This is known as a ''Heliocentric'' model. Another astronomer called [[Galileo Galilei]] built his own [[telescope]], and used it to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time. What he saw backed up Copernicus' idea.  Their ideas were also improved by [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]] who came up with the [[wikt:theory|theory]] of [[gravity]]. At this time the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[church]] decided that Galileo was wrong. [[the Pope|The Pope]] gave the order to lock Galileo up in his house and they did not let him write any more [[book]]s until he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/bio/narrative_7.html|title=Galileo Project - Galileo and the inquistion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Renaissance to Modern Era ====

After Galileo, people used telescopes more often and began to see farther-away objects such as the planets Uranus and Neptune. They also saw how stars were similar to our Sun, but in a range of colours and sizes. They also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as [[Galaxy|galaxies]] and [[nebula]]e.

==== Modern Era ====

The 20th century saw important changes in astronomy.

In 1931, [[Karl Jansky]] discovered radio emission from outside the Earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications, marking the birth of [[radio astronomy]] and the first attempts at using another part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] to observe the sky. Those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy, allowing more discoveries to be made.

The opening of this new window on the [[Universe]] saw the discovery of entirely new things, for example [[pulsar]]s, which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space. The waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source.

The period after [[World War 2]] saw the rise of dedicated {{broken wikt link|observatory|observatories}}, where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites, normally by governments.  For example, [[radio astronomy]] started out of leftover military equipment at [[Jodrell Bank]] after the war.  By 1957, the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovell_Telescope|title=Wikipedia entry on the Lovell Telescope}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Similarly, the end of the 1960s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at [[Mauna Kea]] in [[Hawaii]], a good site for visible and infra-red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies.  Mauna Kea would eventually come to host very large and very accurate telescopes like the [[Keck Observatory]] with its 10-meter mirror.  

The next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry.  This allowed telescopes to be placed in space on [[satellite]]s (such as those that beam satellite television).

Satellite-based telescopes opened up the Universe to human eyes. Turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere blurs images taken by ground-based telescopes, an effect known as [[seeing]].  It is this effect that makes stars &quot;twinkle&quot; in the sky.  As a result, the pictures taken by satellite telescopes in visible light (for example, by the Hubble Space Telescope) are much clearer than Earth-based telescopes, even though Earth-based telescopes are very large.

By placing a telescope in [[orbit]] above the atmosphere, astronomers had access, for the first time in history, to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including those that had been blocked by the atmosphere.  The [[X-ray]]s, [[gamma ray]]s, [[ultraviolet]] light and parts of the [[infra-red]] spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched.  As with other parts of the spectrum, new discoveries were made.

The period from 1970s onwards can be generalised that satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites, causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

==== Current Times ====

==== Future Plans ====

Making new progress in Astronomy is becoming more limited by the observatories and facilities being used at this time.  To make up for these limitations, astronomers have proposed larger and more ambitious projects.  These proposals, some of which are being examined already by governments to see if they will be funded, allow us to glimpse into what the astronomers are planning for the future of astronomy.

== Discoveries ==

This section summarises all the discoveries that Astronomy has made.

Discoveries broadly come in two types:  bodies and phenomena.  Bodies are things in the Universe, whether it is a planet like our Earth or a galaxy like our Milky Way.  Phenomena are events and happenings in the Universe.  

=== Bodies ===

For convenience, this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found: those found around stars are solar bodies, those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies.

==== Solar ====

* [[Planet]]s
* [[Asteroid]]s
* [[Comet]]s

==== Galactic ====

[[Star]]s

Diffuse Objects:
* [[Nebula]]s 
* [[Cluster]]s

Compact Stars:
* [[White dwarf|White dwarves]]
* [[Neutron star]]s
* [[Black hole]]s

==== Cosmic ====

* [[Galaxy|Galaxies]]
* Clusters  
* Superclusters.

=== Phenomena ===

Phenomena are those discoveries related to events and happenings in the Universe.

Broadly, events and happenings in the Universe can be divided into three types: burst, periodic and noise.

Burst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly.  These are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a &quot;burst&quot; of energy.  

Periodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way.  The name periodic comes from period, which is the length of time required for a wave to complete one cycle.  

Noise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago.  The signal from these events bounces around the Universe until it seems to come from everyone and varies little in intensity.  In this way, it resembles &quot;noise&quot;, the background signal that pervades every instrument that tries to do astronomy.  The most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions.

==== Burst ====

* [[Supernova]]s
* [[Nova]]s

==== Periodic ====

* [[Pulsar]]s
* [[Variable star]]s

==== Noise ====

Cosmic background.

== Methodology ==

This section tries to detail how astronomy is done.  

=== Instrumentation ===

Much of astronomy is done through observation of the heavens using instruments.  This section attempts to describe the various instruments used by astronomers, how they work and how they are used.  

==== Telescopes ====

==== Spectrometers ====

==== Satellites ====

=== Techniques ===

These are a list of some of the common ways in which astronomers can use their equipment to get better pictures of the heavens.  

==== Integration ====

Light from a distant source reaches a telescope or satellite and gets measured, normally by a human eye or a camera.  For very dim sources, there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen.  One technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using ''integration'', (which is identical to longer exposures in [[photography]]).

When a normal picture is taken with a camera, the film or CCD plate is exposed to the light for a short amount of time, which is normally useful because a short time means that whatever we are taking a picture of will not have moved much.  Astronomical sources do not move much (only the rotation and movement of the Earth causes them to move across the heavens) the film or CCD plate can be left exposed for longer than an instant.  As light particles reach the camera over time, they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible then the background, until it can be seen.  

Short exposures are easy.  However, longer ones are affected by the Earth's rotation, causing a star wheel effect.  Telescopes at most observatories (and satellite instruments) can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens, making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures.  Also, images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours, days or even months.

In the digital era, digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by [[computer]], which overlays the images after correcting for movement.

==== Aperture Synthesis ====

Smaller telescopes can be combined together to create a larger one which is effectively as large as the distance between the two smaller telescopes.  This technique was first pioneered in [[radio astronomy]].

==== Adaptive Optics ====

=== Data Analysis ===

Data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it.  

The observation is first stored as data.  This data will then have various techniques applied to it (to ''analyse'' it), out of which we may get an answer.

==== Matched Filtering ====

==== Fourier Analysis ====

Fourier analysis in astronomy uses the techniques of Fourier analysis in mathematics to see if an observation (over a length of time) is changing periodically (changes like a wave).  If so, it can extract any and all frequencies and the type of wave pattern as well.  

== Fields ==

Astronomy is a very large subject with many different things to study, and many astronomers specialise in particular areas of astronomy, called fields.  Fields are often themselves further sub-divided into sub-fields and so on.

Astronomers assign fields based on what they perceive to be the largest differences between different bodies and phenomena.  However, as astronomers learn more about the Universe, they often notice that things which they thought were different at first turn out to be similar and things which were similar turn out to be different.  As a result, fields in astronomy are a constantly changing.

A good example of changing fields comes from pulsars, which are things which pulse regularly in radio waves.  These turned out to be similar to some (but not all) of a type of bright source in X-rays called a Low Mass X-ray Binary.  It turned out that all pulsars and some LMXBs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found.  Those LMXBs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes.

Because of its changing nature, the organisation of astronomy is a very confusing thing, even to astronomers, and there are also many terms left over from previous fields that astronomers use which have both modern and older meanings.  

This section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy and the period they were important, plus the terms used (and what they meant by them). It should be noted that astronomy in the Modern Era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic spectrum, although there is some evidence this is changing.

For convenience, the fields are grouped by the major difference that inspired them.

=== Fields by Body ===

==== Solar Astronomy ====
{{main|Sun}}

Solar Astronomy is the study of [[the Sun]]. The Sun is the closest star to Earth, around 92 million (92,000,000) miles away&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF1/142.html|title=Sun/Earth distance, article #144|accessdate=2009-3-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; so it is the easiest to look at in detail. Looking at the Sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed. Changes in the Sun can effect the weather and climate on Earth. A stream of charged [[particle]]s called the [[Solar wind]] is constantly being sent off from the Sun. The Solar Wind hitting the Earth's [[magnetic field]] causes the [[Aurora|northern lights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Isun.html|title=The Solar Wind and the Van Allen radiation belts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying the Sun helped people understand how [[nuclear fusion]] works.

==== Planetary Astronomy ====

Planetary Astronomy is the study of [[planet]]s, [[moons]], [[dwarf planet]]s, [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s as well as other small objects that orbit stars. The planets of our own [[Solar System]] have been studied in depth by many visiting [[spacecraft]] such as [[Cassini-Huygens]] ([[Saturn]]) and the Voyager [[Voyager 1|1]] and [[Voyager 2|2]].

==== Galactic Astronomy ====

Galactic Astronomy is the study of distant [[galaxy|galaxies]].  Studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own, as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it hard for us to observe our own.  Galactic Astronomers attempt to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed and use different types of telescopes and computer simulations to do so.

=== Fields by Electromagnetic Spectrum ===

==== Radio Astronomy ====

==== X-ray Astronomy ====

X-ray Astronomy is the study of the [[Universe]] in the X-ray part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], especially those sources which are much brighter in [[X-ray]]s than in visible light, including [[white dwarf|white dwarves]], [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]/[[neutron star]] [[Binary System|binary systems]].  X-rays cannot penetrate our atmosphere, so all X-ray Astronomy is done using satellites and as a result, the field is recent, dating from the 1960s.

=== Theoretical Fields ===

==== MagnetoHydroDynamics ====

MagnetoHydroDynamics, called MHD for short, is [[Hydrodynamics]] done in the presence of magnetic fields, where  Hydrodynamics is the mathematical modelling of fluid flows.  Hydrodynamics is already useful in astronomy for mathematically modelling how gases behave (as gases behave like fluids).  However, strong magnetic fields are found around many bodies and can drastically change how the gases around them behave, affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around compact stars, which is why MHD is important.

==== Cosmology ====

=== Other Fields ===

==== Gravitational Wave Astronomy ====

Gravitational Wave Astronomy is the study of the [[Universe]] in the [[gravitational wave spectrum]].  So far, all astronomy that has been done has used the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].  Gravitational Waves are ripples in [[spacetime]] emitted by very dense objects changing shape, which include [[White Dwarf|white dwarves]], [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s.  Because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly, the impact of Gravitational Wave Astronomy has been very limited.

__TOC__

== History ==
In the past, people built [[hut]]s and wood [[house]]s to protect themselves from the weather. For safety, they were often close together. Great [[civilization]]s like the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians built large [[temples]] and structures, like the [[Great Pyramids of Giza]]. The [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[Roman]]s made what we now call [[Classical Architecture]]. The Romans, working over 2000 years ago, copied the [[arch]] from the [[Etruscans]], who copied it from the [[Mesopotamian]]s. The [[stone]] [[column]]s, which still hold up so many important buildings, like the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens]], were simply copied from the first wooden posts.

'''Classical Architecture''' is very formal; it always obeyed [[laws]]. It used [[symmetry]], which really means [[balance]], and it used [[proportion]] which means keeping shapes in certain ways. The [[Golden Ratio|Golden Mean]] was a rule (or law) which said, (to put it very simply) if you are making a room, or any other thing, it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times longer than the short side. There are many laws in Classical Architecture, like how high the middle of an arched [[bridge]] needs to be (which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be). These laws were learned from thousands of [[year]]s of experience and they are as true today as they were 2000 years ago.

[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|right|Pyramids in [[Giza]]]]
In some parts of the world, like [[India]], the architecture is famous for [[carving]] the stone on temples and palaces. Different architectural styles were made in [[China]], [[Japan]], Southeast Asia, [[Africa]], [[Mexico]], and Central and [[South America]].

Later, people in Western Europe in the [[Middle Ages]] made [[Romanesque architecture]], then [[Gothic architecture]].  Gothic buildings have tall, pointed [[window]]s and arches.  Many [[church]]es have Gothic architecture. [[Castle]]s were also built at this time. In the East of Europe, churches usually had [[dome]]s. People were copying the Classical Architecture from the past, but adding their own ideas and [[decoration]].

Then, in the [[18th Century]], the [[Industrial Revolution]] happened and people began to [[invent]] machines to make things quickly and cheaply. Many [[factory|factories]] and [[mill]]s were built during, or after this revolution. 100 years later, in the [[Victorian]] era, architects like [[George Fowler Jones]] and [[Decimus Burton]] still followed the Gothic style, to build new churches. Up to this point, buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them. Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller. For example, the cathdral in Ulm, Germany is over 500 feet tall. However, building with stone has its limits, and building too tall could result in collapse, an example of which is the [[Cathedral of Beauvais]], which was never completed. Towards the end of the [[19th Century]], architects began to use the newer, cheaper materials like metal [[girders]] and [[reinforced concrete]] to build. An example is the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]]. Buildings can now be built taller than ever before. We call them [[skyscrapers]]. This new [[technology]] has made us free from traditional limitations, and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials, many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated, replaced, or abandoned.

[[Modernism]] is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies, and its beginnings can been seen as early as [[1890]]. Modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late 20th century, and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then. Many famous buildings existing today, especially skyscrapers like the [[Chrysler Building]] in [[New York]] could not have been built using traditional methods.

'''Anatomy''' is the [[study]] of the [[body|bodies]] of living beings ([[human|people]], [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s). It is like taking the body apart, and looking at its parts ([[organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[muscle]]s and [[bone]]s). People who study ''anatomy'' then look where a certain organ (or bone, or muscle) should be, or where it normally is.

The history of anatomy dates back to 1600 BCE when [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] began studying human anatomy. They discovered the functions of many organs like the liver, spleen, kidneys, heart etc. and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the lymphatic system.

[[Academic]] human anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.

===Body Systems===

There are different systems, such as the [[cardiovascular system]] (the system that gets [[blood]] around the body), the [[muscular system]] (the system that contains muscles), the [[nervous system]] (the system that controls the [[nerve]]s), and the [[skeleton]] (the bones). 
Human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry are similar basic medical sciences, which are usually taught to medical students in their first year at medical school

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;onlyinclude&gt;An '''asteroid''' is a small object in the [[Solar System]] that travels around the sun. It is like a [[planet]], but smaller. The name &quot;asteroid&quot; means &quot;like a star&quot; in the ancient [[Greek language]]. Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky, but they really do move around the [[Sun]], while stars only seem to move because the [[Earth]] spins. Like planets, asteroids do not make their own [[light]]. Because of this, some people think &quot;asteroids&quot; is not a good name, and think that the name &quot;planetoid&quot; (&quot;like a planet&quot;) would be a better name.

Most asteroids are made of [[mineral|rock]], but some are made of [[ice]] or [[metal]]. Most asteroids in our [[Solar System]] are in the [[asteroid belt]] between [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]].&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Formation ==
Asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the [[Solar System]]. These rocks were too small to make a planet, and could not collide to form one. The types of asteroids include Type M, Type S, and Type C.

== Discovery ==
In the 1600s, Gisuppe Piazzi found the first asteroid. It was named [[Ceres]], and is the biggest object in the [[asteroid belt]]. Other asteroids, like [[Juno]], [[Pallas]], and [[Vesta]] were found later. Today, astronomers know of hundreds of thousands of asteroids, which range from less than a mile to 600 miles across.

'''Afghanistān''' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]: '''د افغانستان اسلامي جمهوريت''')([[Dari language|Dari]]: '''جمهوری اسلامی افغانستان''') is a country located in [[South-central Asia]]. It is bordered by [[Pakistan]] in the south and east, [[Iran]] in the west, [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]] in the north, and a narrow piece of land known as the ''Vakhan'', or [[Wakhan Corridor]], connects Afghanistan with [[China]] to the northeast.&lt;ref&gt;[CIA- The World Factbook, Afghanistan. Retrieved on 31 December 2008 https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient times it was crossed by trade routes connecting lands to the east and west. More recently Afghanistan has been devastated by decades of nearly constant warfare.

Afghanistan is approximately 251,826 square miles (652,230 square kilometers) in area. The population of Afghanistan is nearly 30 million, though this figure includes refugees who had fled to Pakistan and Iran. [[Kabul]], the capital and largest city, had roughly 2,850,000 inhabitants in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSO&quot;&gt;&quot;Afghanistan Statistical Yearbook 2008/09&quot;, Central Statistics Office&lt;/ref&gt;

== Land and Climate ==
[[File:Band-e-Amir-1960s.jpg|thumb|left|A few small lakes lie within the mountains of the western [[Hindu Kush]], in Afghanistan.]]
Afghanistan is a mountainous country and mountains cover about four fifths of Afghanistan. The main range is the [[Hindu Kush]], which stretches southwest from the [[Vakhan]]. The Hindu Kush and the smaller ranges that cover most of central Afghanistan are part of the [[Himalayas]]. The highest peak in the country is [[Mount Nowshak]] in the northeast, which rises 24,557 feet (7,485 meters). North of the central mountains are fertile plains and foothills. The southwestern part of the country consists mostly of deserts, the largest being the sandy [[Rigestan]].

Afghanistan's rivers are fed by melting snow and [[glaciers]] in the mountains. Northern streams flow toward the [[Amu Darya]], which forms part of the country's northern border. The Amu Darya is Afghanistan's largest river; but the [[Helmand River]] in the southwest is longer. The [[Kabul River]] provides water for the fertile valleys and basins around [[Kabul]] and [[Jalalabad]].

Afghanistan generally has a dry climate with very cold winters and hot summers. In the winter temperatures drop below 0° F (-18° C) in the windswept mountain regions. Summer temperatures in the desert reach as high as 115° F (46° C). Drought sometimes causes serious problems for the country's farmers. Dust storms and sandstorms are common.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Afghanistan.&quot; Britannica Student Library. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The country is rich in the vibrant blue stone, [[lapis lazuli]], which was used to decorate the tomb of the [[Egypt|Egyptian]] king [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/places/find/afghanistan/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plants and Animals ==
[[File:Uncia uncia 2.jpg|thumb|left|Endangered [[snow leopard|snow leopards]] live in the cold [[Hindu Kush]], but rely on their thick [[fur]] to stay warm. Hunters sell the soft leopard skins in the markets in the capital [[Kabul]].]]
Southern Afghanistan has little vegetation because of the dry climate. The plant cover becomes denser toward the north, where rainfall is more plentiful. The high mountains have tall forests of [[pine]] and [[fir]]. [[Cedar]], [[oak]], [[walnut]], [[alder]], and [[ash trees]] grow at lower elevations.

Many of Afghanistan's wild animals roam the mountains. Among them are [[wolves]], [[foxes]], [[hyenas]], [[jackals]], [[bears]], and [[wild goats]]. [[Gazelles]], [[wild dogs]], and [[wild cats]] such as the [[snow leopard]] are widespread. The country's birds include [[vultures]] and [[eagles]]. The [[rhesus macaque]] and the red flying [[squirrel]] are found in the warmer southern areas of the country.

Decades of [[war]], [[hunting]], and years of [[drought]] have reduced the wildlife population in Afghanistan. [[Tigers]] used to roam the hills, but they are now extinct. Bears and [[wolves]] have been hunted nearly to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/places/find/afghanistan/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== People and Culture ==
[[File:Afghan children in Khost Province.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pashtun]] kids, eastern Afghanistan]]
[[File:Mazar-e sharif - Steve Evans.jpg|thumb|left|The blue-tiled [[mosque]] in [[Mazar-e Sharif]], Afghanistan, is important to all [[muslims]].]]
Throughout history many different groups of people have migrated through or invaded the land that is now Afghanistan. Today the people of Afghanistan, known as ''Afghans'', have a mixture of characteristics passed down from these groups. The largest ethnic group is the [[Pashtuns]] (or Pathans), who make up about two fifth the population. [[Tajiks]] are the second-largest group, making up about one third of the population.&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook&lt;/ref&gt; Tajiks are the direct descendants of the [[Iranian peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Tajik.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Pashtuns are also related to the Iranian peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/places/find/afghanistan/]&lt;/ref&gt; The country's other ethnic groups include the [[Hazaras]], [[Uzbeks]], [[Chahar Aimaks]], [[Turkmens]], [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]]. The Hazaras live in the mountains of central Afghanistan and are believed to be the descendants of the [[Mongols]], because their Dari language contains many Mongol words.&lt;ref&gt;http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/places/find/afghanistan/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:School girls from Herat, West Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tajik]] school girls, western Afghanistan]]
The language of the Pashtuns, called [[Pashto]], is an official language of Afghanistan. The second official language is [[Dari]] (Afghan dialect of [[Farsi]] (Persian)), which is spoken by the Tajik, Hazara, and other groups. Both Pashto and Dari (Persian) belong to the [[Indo-European languages]], but they are written primarily with the [[Arabic alphabet]]. [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] are widely spoken in the north and [[Nuristani language|Nuristani]] and [[Pashai language|Pashai]] are spoken in the east. Almost all Afghans follow the religion of [[Islam]].

Afghanistan is a largely [[rural]] country. Only about one fifth of the population lives in cities. [[Kabul]], the capital, is the largest city. It lies along the [[Kabul River]] south of the [[Hindu Kush]] range. Other cities in Afghanistan include [[Kandahar]], [[Herat|Herāt]], [[Mazar-e Sharif]], and [[Jalalabad]]. The rural population is made up of farmers and nomads. The farmers live mainly in small villages along the rivers. The nomads live in tents while moving from place to place with their livestock and belongings. Few people live in the high central mountains or the deserts in the south and southwest. Millions of people fled Afghanistan for [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]] during the fighting of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

== History ==
[[File:Silk route.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the [[Silk Road]]]]
Afghanistan is in the [[path]] of important trade routes connecting southern and eastern [[Asia]] to [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]. Because of this, many empire builders have conquered the area.

=== Prehistory ===
[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] digging a cave in what is now northeastern Afghanistan (in [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]]), discovered that people lived in the country as early as 100,000 years ago. They found the skull of a [[Neanderthal]], or early human, as well as tools from about 30,000 years ago. In other parts of Afghanistan, archaeologists uncovered [[pottery]] and tools that are 4,000 to 11,000 years old-evidence that Afghans were among the first people in the world to grow crops and raise animals.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Afghanistan.&quot; Britannica Elementary Library.

Farmers and herders settled in the plains surrounding the [[Hindu Kush]] as early as 7000 B.C. These people may have grown wealthy off the [[lapis lazuli]] they found along riverbeds, which they traded to early city sites to the west, across the [[Iranian plateau]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. As farms and villages grew and thrived in Afghanistan, these ancient people eventually devised methods of [[irrigation]] that allowed them to grow crops on the northern Afghanistan desert plains in what would later be known to the West as [[Bactria]]. This [[civilization]] is today called [[BMAC]] (Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex), or the &quot;[[Oxus]] civilization&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, F., Cambon, P., 2008, AFGHANISTAN Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul, page 58, Washington, National Geographic, ISBN 978-1--4262-0295-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oxus civilization expanded as far east as western edge of the [[Indus Valley]] during the period between 2200 and 1800 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, F., Cambon, P., 2008, AFGHANISTAN Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul, page 73, Washington, National Geographic, ISBN 978-1--4262-0295-7&lt;/ref&gt; These people, who were the ancestors of the [[Indo-Iranians]], used the term &quot;[[Aryan]]&quot; as a religious, cultural, and ethnic self designation. Scholars know this when they read the ancient texts of these people; the [[Avesta]] of [[Iranian people]] and the [[Vedas]] of [[Indo-Aryans]].&lt;ref&gt;[R.

[[Zoroaster]], the founder of the [[Zoroastrian]] religion, the world's earliest [[monotheistic]] religion, lived in the area (somewhere north of today's Afghanistan), around 1000 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/articles/zoroaster-ii-general-survey Encyclopaedia Iranica: ZOROASTER ii.

Even though there are later traditions which place him in Azerbaijan and Media, it is more reasonable to locate Zoroaster somewhere in eastern [ancient] Iran [today's Afghanistan] along with the rest of the Avesta. Further, the two Avestan dialects belong linguistically to eastern [ancient] Iran [today's Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient history ===
[[File:Afghanistan region during 500 BC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bactria]], Aria and Arachosia were the ancient [[satrapies]] of the [[Persian]] [[Achaemenid Empire]] that made up most of what is now Afghanistan during 500 B.C. [[Tajiks]] and [[Pashtuns]] are the descendants of the ancient inhabitants of these lands.]]
By the middle of the sixth century BC, the [[Achaemenids]] conquered the land, which was previously conquered by the [[Medes]], and made it part of the [[Persian empire]]. [[Alexander the great]] defeated and conquered the Persian Empire in 330 BC. He founded few cities in the area and [[Greek]] culture and language continued to influence the people for a long period, right up to the [[Islamic conquest]] in the 7th century A.D. After Alexander the great, [[Greco-Bactrians]], [[Scythians]], [[Kushans]], [[Parthians]] and [[Sassanians]] took over.&lt;ref&gt;[Encyclopedia Britannica, ancient Iran. Retrieved on 31 December 2008 http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/851961/ancient-Iran]&lt;/ref&gt; Kushans spread [[Buddhism]] from [[India]] in the 1st century B.C., and Buddhism remained an important religion in the area until the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;[Encyclopedia Iranica, BUDDHISM i. In Pre-Islamic Times. Retrieved on 12 September 2010 http://iranica.com/articles/buddhism-i]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] were the remainder of Buddhism in Afghanistan. Those giant statues were destroyed by the hard-line ruling [[Taliban]] in 2001, despite international protests in defence of the priceless art. The Taliban believed that those ancient statues were [[Islam|un-Islamic]].  

=== Medieval history ===
[[Arabs]] introduced [[Islam]] in the 7th century and slowly began spreading the new religion. In the 9th and 10th centuries, numerous local Islamic dynasties rose to power. One of the earliest was the [[Tahirids|Ṭāhirids]] of Khorāsān, whose kingdom included [[Balkh]] and [[Herat|Herāt]]; they established virtual independence from the [[Abbasids|ʿAbbāsid Caliphate]] in 820. The Ṭāhirids were succeeded in 867–869 by a native dynasty from [[Sistan|Sīstān]], the [[Saffarids|Ṣaffārids]]. Local princes in the north soon became [[wikt:feudatory|feudatories]] of the powerful [[Samanids|Sāmānids]], who ruled from [[Bukhara]]. From 872 to 999 Bukhara, [[Samarkand]], and [[Balkh]] enjoyed a golden age under Sāmānid rule.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Afghanistan.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turks|Turkish]] [[Ghaznavids]] took over in the 10th century and made [[Ghazni]] and Bust ([[Lashkar Gah|Lashkar Gāh]]) their capitals. [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Maḥmūd]], a great Ghaznavid [[sultan]], conquered the [[Punjab]] and [[Multan]] and carried his raids into the heart of [[India]]. 

The north-eastern parts of the Persian empire were locally recognized as ''[[Greater Khorasan|Khorāsān]]'', being literally the “Land of the Sun”, which was a prosperous and important province of Persia, as it was the seat of many rulers. It remained the cultural capital of Persia until the devastating [[Mongol]] invasion of the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Lorentz, J. Historical Dictionary of Iran. 1995 ISBN 0-8108-2994-0AFGJANISTAN&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Canons of medicine.JPG|thumb|left|[[Avicenna]]'s writings helped convey the thought of the [[Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] to the thinkers of [[western Europe]], and his ‘Canon of Medicine' became the definitive work in its field for centuries.]]
Khorasan reached its peak of civilization in the twelfth century, and cities like [[Herat|Herāt]], [[Balkh]] and [[Ghazni]] (all in today's Afghanistan) were centres of science and culture. The New [[Persian language|Persian]] [[literature]] arose and flourished in Khorasan. The early Persian poets such as [[Rudaki]] were from Khorasan. Moreover, [[Ferdowsi]], the author of [[Shahnameh]], the national [[epic]] of Iran, and [[Rumi]], the famous [[Sufi]] poet, were also from Khorasan. It has produced scientists such as [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Al-Biruni]], [[Omar Khayyám]], [[Al-Khwarizmi]], and many others who are widely well-known for their significant contributions in various domains such as [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[medicine]], [[physics]], [[geography]], and [[geology]].

[[Mongols]] came in the 13th century and destroyed much of the Persian region. [[Timur]], the Turkic conqueror, took over a large part of the country in the end of 14th century. Timur's successors, the [[Timurids]] (1405–1507), were great patrons of learning and the arts who enriched their capital city of [[Herat|Herāt]] with fine buildings. Under their rule Afghanistan enjoyed peace and prosperity.

In the late [[middle ages]], there was a region in the south of Khorasan and along the [[Sulaiman mountains]] (in the west of today's [[Pakistan]]) which was called &quot;Afghanistan&quot; and it was the homeland of Afghans or [[Pashtuns]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vogelsang&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Afghans|last1=Vogelsang|first1=Willem|authorlink=|coauthors=|volume=|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=|isbn=0631198415, 9780631198413|page=18|pages=382|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9kfJ6MlMsJQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Afghans&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 16th to the early 18th century, Afghanistan was controlled between the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids of Persia]] and [[Mughal Empire|Moghul rulers of India]]. Safavids and Mughals sometimes occasionally oppressed the Afghans. In 1709, the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotaki tribe]] of Afghans revolted and fully defeated the Shia Safavid Persians and then the Mughals of India in 1747. 

A great Pashtun leader named [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] is considered the founder of Afghanistan as a united country. After the Persian ruler of the region was killed in 1747, Durrani was crowned king. During his rule he created a unified country out of lands that had been controlled by local rulers.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Afghanistan.&quot; Britannica Elementary Library. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Recent history ===
[[File:Ahmad-Shah-Durani.jpeg|thumb|right|150px|[[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] unified the [[Pashtun]] tribes and founded the state of Afghanistan in 1747. He created the second largest [[Muslim]] [[Empire]] (after the [[Ottoman Empire]]) of the 18th century, that extended from the [[Amu Darya]] to the [[Indian Ocean]] and from [[Khorasan|Khorāsān]] into [[Kashmir]], the [[Punjab]], and [[Sind]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Aḥmad Shāh Durrānī.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the 1800s, Afghanistan became involved in a rivalry between the [[British empire|British]] and [[Russian empire|Russian]] empires and served as a [[buffer zone]] between these two empires. [[Russia]] was the great power to the north, and [[Britain]] controlled [[India]] to the east. As Russia expanded southward across [[central Asia]], Britain believed that its control over India was threatened. To stop the Russian advance, Britain tried to conquer Afghanistan. Britain fought wars in Afghanistan from 1839 to 1842 and from 1878 to 1880, winning some control over the country's affairs. In a third war, however, Afghanistan won independence from Britain in 1919, when the king of Afghanistan, [[Amanullah Khan]], declared independence from [[United Kingdom]] control over Afghan foreign affairs.

[[File:Zerstörtes Kabul mit Darul-Aman-Palast-2.jpg|thumb|left|Three decades of war and the [[Taliban]] rule left Afghanistan in ruins.]]
After independence Afghanistan continued as a [[monarchy]]. From the 1930s into the 1970s the country was ruled by stable governments with a king as head of state. In 1973, however, political crises led to the overthrow of the king. The country's new leaders ended the monarchy and made Afghanistan a [[republic]].

In 1978 a [[Communist]] political party supported by the [[Soviet Union]] seized control of Afghanistan's government. This move sparked rebellions throughout the country. The government asked the Soviet Union for military assistance. The Soviets took advantage of the situation and [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|invaded Afghanistan in December 1979]].

Most of the people of Afghanistan opposed the Soviet presence. For nearly a decade anti-Communist Islamic forces known as ''mujahideen'' fought the invaders. The [[United States]] and other anti-Soviet countries supported the mujahideen. The Soviet Army lost more than 10,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, and millions of Afghans left the country for [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]]. In 1989 the Soviet Army withdrew the last of its troops.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Afghanistan.&quot; Britannica Student Library. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Soviets left, various Afghan groups began fighting for control of the country. A very conservative [[Islamic]] group known as the [[Taliban]] emerged as the most powerful of these groups. By the late 1990s the Taliban had gained control over most of Afghanistan. Small groups continued to fight against the Taliban in the northern part of the country.

The Taliban ruled Afghanistan according to their strict version of Islamic law. People whom the Taliban believed violated these laws were given harsh public punishments. In addition, the Taliban severely restricted the [[rights of women]]. Because of such policies, most countries did not consider the Taliban to be the legitimate, or lawful, government of Afghanistan.

[[File:Hamid Karzai in February 2009.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Hamid Karzai]], the current president of Afghanistan]]
The Taliban also angered other countries by allowing suspected terrorists to live in Afghanistan. Among them were [[Osama bin Laden]] and members of his organization, [[al-Qaeda]]. In September 2001 the United States blamed bin Laden for [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C.]] The Taliban refused to hand over bin Laden to the United States. In response, the United States and its allies launched a bombing campaign against the Taliban in October 2001. Within months the Taliban abandoned Kabul and a new government came to power, but fighting continued.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Afghanistan.&quot; Britannica Student Library. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2004, [[Hamid Karzai]], became the first [[democracy|democratically]] elected president of Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[CIA- The World Factbook, Afghanistan. Retrieved on 31 December 2008 https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government ==
Afghanistan is a newly formed [[democracy]]. Under the new [[constitution]], the [[president]] and two [[vice presidents]] are elected every five years. The [[International Security Force Assistance]] (ISAF) helps the government maintain peace and rebuild the country. 

The government still faces problems with the [[Taliban]], internal security, and public services.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Argentina}}
[[File:Argentina - Político.png|260px|thumb|Map of Argentina]]

Argentina is almost 3,700 km long from north to south, and 1,400 km from east to west (maximum values). It can be divided into three parts: the [[Pampa]]s in the central part of the country, [[Patagonia]] in the southern part down to [[Tierra del Fuego]]; and the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] along the western border with [[Chile]], with the highest point located in the province of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. [[Cerro Aconcagua]], at 6,960 metres (22,834 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), is the [[Americas|Americas']] highest mountain.

The most important rivers include the [[Rio de la Plata|River Plate]], [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]], [[Bermejo River|Bermejo]], [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and the largest river, the [[Paraná River|Paraná]]. River Plate was incorrectly translated though, and should have been translated to English as River of (the) Silver. River Plate is also a famous Buenos Aires soccer team.

== Other information ==
The majority of the Argentineans are descendants of Europeans mainly from [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], other Europeans countries and [[Mestizo]] representing more than 90% of the total population of the country.[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html]

{{seealso|List of Argentines}}

Argentina is a [[Christian]] country. Most of Argentina's people (80 percent) are [[Roman Catholic]], but it is not the state religion&lt;ref&gt;http://biblioteca.idict.villaclara.cu/biblioteca/colecciones-culturales/lit-argentina/argentina/poblacion/religion&lt;/ref&gt;. Argentina also has the largest population of Jewish community after Israel and US. Many Middle Eastern immigrants who were Muslims converted to Catholicism, but there are still Muslims as well.

Medicine is socialized and so is education, making Argentina's literacy rate about 98%. State University is free as well.

'''Austria''' ([[German language|German]]: '''Österreich'''), officially &quot;Republic of Austria&quot;, is a country in [[Central Europe]]. Around Austria there are [[Germany]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]]. Currently, the chancellor is [[Werner Faymann]]. Austria has been a [[state|member-state]] of the [[European Union|EU]] since [[1995]].

The people in Austria speak [[German language|German]], a few also [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The capital of Austria is [[Vienna]] (Wien). 

Austria is more than a thousand years old. Its history can be followed to the [[ninth century]]. At that time the first people moved to the land now known as Austria. The name &quot;Ostarrichi&quot; is first written in an official document from [[996]]. Since then this word has developed into the Modern German word ''Österreich''.

Austria is a democratic state and has nine federal states ({{lang-de|''Bundesländer''}}): [[Vorarlberg]], the [[Tyrol]], [[Salzburg]], [[Carinthia]], [[Styria]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Vienna]] and [[Burgenland]]. It is a [[neutral]] state, that means it does not take part in wars with other countries. Austria is in the [[United Nations]] since 1955 and in the [[European Union]] since 1995.

== History ==
=== Ancient times ===
There has been human settlement in the area that is now Austria for a long time. The first settlers go back to the Paleolithic age. That was the time of the [[Neanderthal]]s. They left works of art such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. In the Neolithic age people were living there to dig for [[mineral]] resources, especially [[copper]]. [[Ötzi]], a [[mummy]] found in a [[glacier]] between Austria and Italy, is from that time. In the [[Bronze Age]] people built bigger settlements and fortresses, especially where there were [[mineral]] resources. [[Salt mine|Salt mining]] began near [[Hallstatt]]. At that time, [[Celt]]s began to form the first states.

=== The Romans ===
The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] settled in most of modern Austria. They built larger cities. The most important of these were [[Carnuntum]] (near Vienna), [[Virunum]] (north of [[Klagenfurt]]) and [[Teurnia]] (near [[Spittal an der Drau]]). 
&lt;!--
Quite a bit still missing
 --&gt;

=== Modern times ===
Austria was an empire from about 800 to [[1918]] and was ruled by The House of [[Habsburg]] for most of that period. Then it became a [[republic]]. The ''First Republic'' was from 1918 to 1938, the ''Second Republic'' has been from 1945. From 1938 to 1945 Austria was part of Germany.

== Geography ==
[[File:Au-map.png|thumb|left|150px|Map of Austria]]
Austria is a largely [[mountain]]ous country since it is partially located in the [[Alps]]. The high mountainous Alps in the west of Austria flatten somewhat into low lands and plains in the east of the country.

'''Armenia''' is a country in Asia. Its [[capital (city)|capital city]] is [[Yerevan]]. Armenia received its independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in [[1991]].

Armenia touches [[Turkey]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Iran]].

There are some minorities living in Armenia, such as [[Greece|Greek]], [[Russia]]n, and other minorities, and more than 90% of the people are ethnic [[Armenians]].  Also, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], is by far the largest religion in the country. There are a small amount of other [[Christians]], [[Muslims]] and [[atheists]].

Armenia is the place that some Christians believe [[Noah's Ark]] landed, and Noah's family settled.  The Armenian name for Armenia (Hayastan) means Land of Haik.  Haik was the name of a great-great-grandson of Noah.

Throughout history, Armenia's size has changed many times.  Today Armenia is much smaller than it was once. In 80 BC, the Kingdom of Armenia covered parts of what is today Turkey, [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], Azerbaijan, and, of course, Armenia.

From [[1920]] to [[1991]], Armenia was a [[Communist]] country as a member of the [[Soviet Union]].

Today, Armenia's borders are locked with [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]], due to conflicts. In 1992, Armenia and Azerbaijan had a war over the land of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. The fighting stopped in 1994, and Armenia has had control over this land, but Azerbaijan still disputes about the land.

'''Archaeology''' is the study of the [[past]] by looking for the remains and artifacts ([[history|historical things]]) left by the people who lived long ago. These remains can include old [[coin]]s, [[tool]]s, [[building]]s, and [[garbage]]. Archaeologists, the people who study archaeology, use these remains to understand how people lived.

Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past, because so many people use the past to know where they come from. 


==Fieldwork==
When archaeologists do fieldwork, they look for remains, often by digging deep in the ground. When things are found, or even when nothing is found, the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist's base, perhaps a [[university]] or [[museum]]. They record every piece of information by writing down on paper or entering the information into a computer, so that they can build a picture of everything that is found. As [[settlement]]s (places where people lived in groups) change and grow, old buildings are often buried to make space for new buildings. Ancient [[Rome]], for example, is now up to 40 feet (12 metres) below the present city. This is why archaeological fieldwork is expensive and why it takes a long time.

==Fields of interest==
[[Archaeologist]]s do not all study the same [[civilization]]s, but they specialize in different areas of interest. Some fields of interest include [[Ancient Egypt]] (these specialists are called [[Egyptologist]]s), [[Ancient Greece]], or the [[Vikings]]. Archaeologists study every [[civilization]] that is known, especially the ones where there is no written [[history]]. They can study any time period. For example, one might study the beginning of human life in Africa, or one might study [[World War II]]. Some archaeologists study things that are now underwater. They search for [[shipwreck|sunken ships]] or [[city|cities]] that have been lost under the sea.
 
==Sites==
[[Stonehenge]], in [[England]] is a famous archaeological site, or place. Other famous sites include [[Angkor Wat]], [[Machu Picchu]], and [[Great Zimbabwe]]. In many countries, [[government]]s and other groups of people protect important sites so that they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them.

Sometimes archaeological sites are found when [[foundation]]s are dug for new [[building]]s. Archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens, because people building are always in a hurry. Quite often as soon as the archaeologists have finished their work, the remains that they have found will be covered over, unless they are of very great importance.

'''Animalia''' is the name of the '''animal kingdom'''. It is a [[kingdom]] which contains all [[animals]]. Animals are living things which do not make use of [[light]] to get [[energy]] and building materials (like plants do) to grow. They eat [[plant]]s or other animals. Most higher animals can also move around, which is another difference with [[plant]]s. Animals are divided into groups as well.

==Grouping animals==
When scientists look at animals, they find things that certain animals have in common. They can then group the animals, according to some of these things.

One classification is that some animals have a [[backbone]], and others do not. The animals with a backbone are called [[vertebrate]]s, those without one are called [[invertebrate]]s.


Examples of invertebrates are [[bee]]s, [[dragonfly|dragonflies]], [[jellyfish]], etc.

Some vertebrates are:
*[[fish]] (even if they are several animals, they are still called fish)
*[[amphibian]]s
*[[reptile]]s
*[[bird]]s
*[[mammal]]s

Some invertebrates are:
*[[insect]]s
*[[spider]]s
*[[mollusc]]s (like [[squid]])
*[[worm]]s
*[[jellyfish]]

The problem with this classification though is that most animals are invertebrates. Therefore, other classifications are used more often, today. The vertebrate [[phylum]] is more commonly known as [[chordata]]. There are many other phylums, and every other one of them contain invertebrates.

'''Animals''' are metazoan [[life|living]] things. They do not make their own [[food]] by themselves. Animals usually eat other living things (animals, [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], etc.) to get energy to live. Some are [[parasitism|parasites]], and some have [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[protist]]s as [[symbiosis|symbionts]]. 

There are millions of animal [[species]]. Some are big and some are small; some are fat and some are tall. Some live in water, others live on the ground and some animals can fly. Being able to move from one place to another is a distinctive [[trait]] (characteristic) of an animal.

Some animals eat only plants; they are called [[herbivore]]s. Other animals eat only [[meat]] and are called [[carnivore]]s. Animals that eat both plants and meat are called [[omnivore]]s. Animals are divided into groups; see [[animalia]]. Their mode of nutrition is known as heterotrophic nutrition because they eat other living organisms as food in order to survive. 

There are animals living in solitary and in groups. Examples of animals living in solitary are tigers, rhinoceros, cheetahs and more. Examples of animals living in groups are coyotes, bees, monkeys and more. Animals living in solitary do not have to share food with each other. Animals living in groups have better protection against becoming the prey of others. Bees and ants are grouped in a special group called a colony. In a colony, the animals work together in a special way and usually have a leader. The leader of the bees is called the Queen Bee. 

The animal kingdom is varied. There are many types of animals. But, the common animals you know are only about 3% of the animal kingdom. There are many other animals, such as [[insects]] and [[sponge]]s. Animals can mainly be divided into two main groups, the [[invertebrate]]s, and the [[vertebrate]]s. The vertebrates are animals with a [[backbone]], or [[spine]], and the invertebrates without. Invertebrates include [[insects]], [[crustaceans]], [[molluscs]], [[coral]]s, [[worm]]s, and much more. The vertebrates are divided into 5 groups, [[fish]], [[birds]], [[amphibians]], [[reptiles]] and [[mammals]]. 
Animals breathe Oxygen to live.
Below are some [http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/collective/?view=uk common collective nouns] for groups of animals:

:A '''herd''' of horses, buffalo, cows (mainly for herbivores)
:A '''pack''' of wolves, wild dogs (mainly for carnivorous animals living in groups)
:A '''flock''' of birds
:A '''colony''' of ants, bees
:A '''smack''' of jellyfish
:A '''swarm''' of locust (or other insects that fly together in large numbers)
:A '''school''' or '''shoal''' of fish or other water dwelling creatures
:A '''skulk''' of foxes
:A '''murder''' of crows

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Acceleration''' is a [[measure]] of how [[speed|fast]] [[velocity]] [[wikt:change|changes]]. Acceleration is the change of velocity [[divide]]d by the change of [[time]]. Acceleration is a [[vector]], and therefore includes both a [[size]] and a [[direction]].
 
=== Examples ===
* An object moving [[north]] at 10 meters per second. The object speeds up and now is moving north at 15 [[meter]]s per [[second]]. The object has accelerated. 
* An [[apple]] falls down. It starts falling at 0 meters per second. At the end of the first second, the apple is moving at 9.8 meters per second. The apple has accelerated. At the end of the second second, the apple is moving down at 19.6 meters per second. The apple has accelerated again.
* Jane walks [[east]] at 3 [[kilometer]]s per [[hour]]. Jane's velocity does not change. Jane's acceleration is [[zero]]. 
* Tom walks [[east]] at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom turns and walks [[south]] at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom has had a nonzero acceleration. 
* Sally walks [[east]] at 3 kilometers per hour. Sally slows down. After, Sally walks [[east]] at 1.5 kilometers per hour. Sally has had a nonzero acceleration.

== Finding acceleration ==

Acceleration is the [[rate]] of change of the [[velocity]] of an object. Acceleration &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{{a}}&lt;/math&gt; can be found by using:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{{a}} = {\mathbf{v_1} - \mathbf{v_0} \over { t_1 - t_0 }}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity at the start
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity at the end
:&lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the time at the start 
:&lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; is the time at the end 

Sometimes the change in velocity &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v_1} - \mathbf{v_0}&lt;/math&gt; is written as Δ&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes the change in time &lt;math&gt;{ t_1 - t_0 }&lt;/math&gt; is written as Δt.

In difficult situations, the acceleration can be calculated using [[mathematics]]: in [[calculus]], acceleration is the [[derivative]] of the velocity (with respect to time), &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Units of measurement ===
Acceleration has its own [[units of measurement]]. For example, if velocity is measured in meters per second, and if time is measured in seconds, then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). 

=== Other words ===
Acceleration can be [[positive]] or [[negative]]. When the acceleration is negative (but the velocity does not change direction), it is sometimes called deceleration. For example, when a car brakes it decelerates. Physicists usually only use the word &quot;acceleration&quot;. 

== Newton's second law of motion ==
There are [[rule]]s for how things [[move]]. These rules are called &quot;[[law]]s of [[motion (physics)|motion]]&quot;. [[Isaac Newton]] is the [[scientist]] who first wrote down the main laws of motion.
According to [[Newton's laws of motion#Second Law|Newton's Second Law of Motion]], the [[force]] something needs to accelerate an object depends on the object's [[mass]] (the amount of &quot;stuff&quot; the object is made from or how &quot;heavy&quot; it is).
The formula of Newton's Second Law of Motion is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the force, and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the mass. 
This formula is very well-known, and it is very important in [[physics]]. Newton's Second Law of Motion, in short &quot;Newton's Second Law&quot;, is often one of the first things that physics students learn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Black pudding''' is an English name for blood sausage.  It is [[food]] made by [[cooking]] down the [[blood]] of any [[mammal]] (usually [[pig]]s or cattle) with meat, fat or filler until it is thick enough to [[congealing|congeal]] (become firm or solid) when cooled.

==Types of Black pudding==
[[File:Blutwurst.jpg|thumb|German ''Blutwurst'']]
In [[England]] blood sausage is called  ''Black Pudding''. The ingredients include pig's blood, [[suet]], [[bread]], [[barley]] and [[oats|oatmeal]]. The most common kind of German ''blutwurst'' is made from fatty pork meat, beef blood and filler such as barley. Though already cooked and &quot;ready to eat&quot; it is usually served warm.

Other kinds of blood sausage include ''boudin noir'' (France), ''boudin rouge'' ([[Creole]] and [[Cajun]]) and ''morcilla'' (Spain).

==History==
A [[legend]] says that blood sausage was invented in a [[gambling|bet]] between two [[Bavarian]] [[butcher]]s drunk on the alcoholic drink [[absinthe]] during the [[14th century]]. [[Homer]]'s 
''Odyssey'' from Ancient [[Greece]] says that &quot;As when a man besides a great fire has filled a sausage with fat and blood and turns it this way and that and is very eager to get it quickly roasted...&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''boot device''' makes a [[computer]] work.  It is named after a [[boot]] which fits on the [[foot]].  The word [[bootstrap]] is also closely related, and means, to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better.

Devices that can boot a computer are usually '''boot disks''' or '''boot drives''' 
(normally a [[hard drive]], but can be a [[floppy disk]] or a [[compact disk|CD]]).  Some [[network computer]]s use ''boot chips'' that get the [[operating system]] over a [[network]].  [[Web phone]]s also use such chips to identify the user to the [[cell network]].  '''Boot card''' standards may let many users boot [[kiosk computer]]s with full [[privacy]] and access to all [[applications]] they own. There are also '''boot boards''' or '''boot ''add-in'' cards''' that are more permanent than boot cards.

Some people refer to the boot device as just a '''boot''' and non-boot devices as '''data device'''s, although it is not the [[computer]] but the [[operating system]] that cares about the difference between these.

==Origin==
The boot in '''boot device''' is the same as [[booting]] (or starting up). This is short for bootstrapping, or to start with simple stuff and make complex stuff out of it.

[[File:Wooden boots-Sanita-lightblue.jpg|thumb|100px|right]]
A '''boot''' is a type of [[footwear]] that protects the [[foot]] and [[ankle]]. Boots are higher and larger than [[shoe]]s and [[sandal]]s. Some boots are high enough to protect the [[leg|calves]] (lower part of the leg) as well.  Some boots are held on with ''bootstraps'' or ''bootlaces''.  Some also have '''spats''' or ''gaiters'' to keep water out.  Most have a very strong ''boot sole'', the bottom part of a boot.

== Types of boots ==
* '''Rain boots''' (or rubber boots) are made from [[rubber]] or [[plastic]]. Rain boots protect a person's feet from [[water]] and [[rain]]. People who work on [[fishing]] boats and [[farmer]]s wear rubber boots to keep their feet dry. People who work in [[chemical industry|chemical]] factories wear rubber boots to protect their feet from dangerous chemicals.

* '''Winter boots''' are boots that keep a person's feet warm in cold weather. People in cold countries such as [[Canada]] and [[Sweden]] wear winter boots during the cold season. Winter boots can be made from many different materials, such as [[leather]], [[fabric]], or [[plastic]]. Winter boots are [[thermal insulation|insulated]] with wool or fur to keep the feet warm. Most winter boots also keep people's feet dry.

* '''Work boots''' (or &quot;[[construction]] boots&quot;) are designed for people who work in construction or [[factory]] jobs. Work boots often have a steel toe cover to protect the person's toes. Work boots are usually made of strong leather, to protect the person's foot from sharp objects or dangerous chemicals. Some work boots have a flat piece of [[steel]] in the sole to protect the foot from sharp [[nail]]s. Many countries require construction workers to wear work boots when they are on a construction site.

== Other meanings ==
People in English-speaking countries refer to boots in a figurative or [[joke|joking]] manner when they tell someone &quot;to lift yourself up by your own bootstraps&quot;.  This is a joke because it is impossible for someone to lift themselves up by their own bootstraps. What the person is really saying is &quot;figure out your problem yourself&quot; or &quot;find your own way to better your situation.&quot;

As well, people sometimes use the term '''to bootstrap'''. This is an [[idiom]] meaning &quot;to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better.&quot; The word [[Booting|&quot;boot&quot;]] is also used to describe how a [[computer]] starts up when a person presses the &quot;on&quot; button. 

Another term &quot;To boot&quot; is an [[idiom]] meaning [[wikt:also|also]].  For example, people say &quot;he had a beer, and a whiskey to boot.&quot; This means that the person had a beer, and also had a glass of whiskey. Another [[slang]] use of the word &quot;boot&quot; is to say &quot;Fred got the boot from the company.&quot; This means that Fred got [[unemployment|fired]] from the company.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bancruptcy''' is when someone or an organisation does not have enough [[money]] to pay all of its [[debt]] is insolvent. If it applies for protection by [[law]] it may then be '''bankrupt'''.  

In many countries a [[company]] or [[business]] can &quot;file for [[bankruptcy protection]]&quot; so that [[creditor]]s cannot destroy all of the [[physical capital]] and [[goodwill]] by breaking it apart and moving it away.  All this provides is more [[time]] to work out a new [[deal]] between the owners and the people the business owes money.

An individual person who owes debt and cannot pay it can also &quot;declare bankruptcy&quot;.  That person will lose all but some basic things they [[own]], but all the debt will go away.  Normally they cannot easily borrow money again for years.

Very often, a [[creditor]] threatens a [[debtor]] with [[debt slavery]], if the debtor does not know that they have a right to go '''bankrupt'''.  This is a [[human rights]] problem in very many countries. Also, some creditors continue to bother a debtor even though bankruptcy laws say they should not, hoping that the debtor will pay them money they might not otherwise get.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Breakfast sausage''' is a type of fresh [[pork]] [[sausage]] made from [[season]]ed [[ground]] [[meat]] mixed with [[bread]] crumbs. Breakfast sausage has a blander flavor than many other types of sausage, such as Polish or Italian-style sausages.

==Using breakfast sausages==
Breakfast sausages are not [[curing|cured]] or [[smoking|smoked]] like other types of sausages, which means that they have to be cooked soon after they are purchased (unless they are frozen).  Uncooked sausages should be stored in the [[refrigerator]] or the [[Refrigerator|freezer]]. Individuals handling them should wash their hands in hot [[soap]]y water, because uncooked pork is unhealthy for humans. Pork sausages have to be heated until all of the meat inside is cooked. 

They are usually [[fry|fried]] or grilled in a pan until they are browned and served at [[breakfast]], often with cooked [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[pancake]]s, and [[toast]]ed bread. Breakfast sausages are also used in other dishes, such as &quot;toads in the hole&quot; a cooked egg dish.

==Types of breakfast sausages==
Different types made from pork and [[beef]] mixtures as well as [[poultry]] can now be found. There are also [[vegetarian]] types that use [[tofu|textured vegetable protein]] in place of meat. Breakfast sausages are available in patties or slices from a large roll, or in weiner-like links of different lengths and thickness.

'''Beekeeping''' or '''apiculture''' is the [[farming]] of [[honeybee]]s.

== Uses ==
The keeping of bees is usually, and has been in the past, for [[honey]]. That is becoming less true. Instead, it is more used for [[crop]] [[pollination]] and other products. These are [[:wikt:wax|wax]] and [[propolis]]. 

There is only one queen bee in each hive and she is bigger than the rest. She lays all the eggs, which makes all the other bees in the hive her daughters and sons. However, they do not control the hive.

==Types of beekeeping==
The largest beekeeping operations are agricultural businesses that are operated for profit. Some people also have small beekeeping operations that they do as a [[hobby]].

      <comment>/* Pronunciation (The Way People Say Things) in British English */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''British English''' is the kind of [[English language]] which is used in the [[United Kingdom]] and countries that used to be in the [[British Empire]].

== Pronunciation (The Way People Say Things) in British English ==
In the United Kingdom, many different people say words in different ways. For example: a man from a place near [[London]] may not say his &quot;r&quot;s the same as a man from [[Scotland]] or a man from [[Northern Ireland]]. In fact, people's languages are different across the UK, depending on the area you are in for example in [[Wales]] one might speak [[welsh]] or in [[Ireland]] [[Irish]](although they are not part of the UK) . across the country the accent is different for instance in [[Liverpool]] one speaks with a &quot;scouse&quot; accent or in [[London]] one speaks with a &quot;cockney&quot; accent. Different variations on all of British English exist from the manner in which words are pronounced to the manner in which they are spelt. One place people speak English in a different way is [[Cornwall]], where the [[Cornish dialect]] is spoken.

== Spelling in British English == 
British English often keeps more traditional ways of spelling words than American English. 

* Some British English words end in &quot;re&quot; that are often simplified to &quot;er&quot; in American English. 
::British English: centre, litre, metre. 
::American English: center, liter, meter.
* Some British English words end in &quot;our&quot; and are simplified to &quot;or&quot; in American English. 
::British English: colour, favour, honour, labour 
::American English: color, favor, honor, labor 
* Some British English words the have come originally from the Greek language use &quot;ph&quot;. This has been changed to &quot;f&quot; in some other languages. 
::British English: Sulphur, not Sulfur
* Some words in British English use &quot;s&quot; where &quot;z&quot; is used in American English. 
::British English: colonisation, realisation, organisation
::American English: colonization, realization, organization
* Many of these rules are also used in other countries outside of the [[United Kingdom]], mostly in countries that are members in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

== Vocabulary in British English ==
In British English, &quot;dock&quot; refers to the [[water]] in the space between two &quot;piers&quot; or &quot;wharfs&quot;. In American English, the &quot;pier&quot; or &quot;wharf&quot; could be called a &quot;dock&quot;, and the water between would be a &quot;slip&quot;.

Some simpler differences:

British - American
* accelerator - throttle
* [[autumn]] - fall
* [[biscuit]] - cookie
* bonnet - hood (of a car)
* [[boot]] - trunk (of a car)
* bum, arse - butt, ass
* [[car]] - automobile
* caravan - trailer, mobile home
* chips - [[French fries]]
* courgette - [[zucchini]]
* crisps - chips
* face flannel - washcloth 
* [[flat]] - apartment
* [[football (soccer)|football]] - soccer
* garden - yard
* handbag - purse
* jumper - sweater
* [[lift]] - elevator
* lorry - truck
* manual gearbox - stick shift
* metro, underground, tube - subway
* motorway - freeway
* mum - mom
* nappy - diaper
* number plate - license plate
* pavement - sidewalk
* pram - stroller
* petrol - gas or gasoline
* post - mail, mailbox
* [[railway]] - railroad
* [[shift]]ing - moving
* shopping trolley - shopping cart
* surname - last name 
* take-away - take-out
* tap - faucet
* trousers - pants
* to let - to rent
* torch - flashlight
* tram - streetcar
*grey - [[gray]]

:''Being is also a present tense part of [[to be]]''

The word '''being''' means the same as &quot;person&quot;. [[man|Men]], [[woman|women]], and [[child]]ren are [[human being]]s.

Some people write stories or make [[movie]]s about beings from other [[planet]]s. Most [[religion]]s talk about [[supernatural]] beings, for example [[spirit]]s, [[angel]]s, [[devil]]s, [[deity|gods]], or [[God]].

Being is something THAT IS.

[[File:Forbidden City1.JPG|300px|thumb|The [[Forbidden City]], home to the [[Emperor of China|Emperors]] of the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties.]]
'''Beijing''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 北京 /Běijīng/) is the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The city used to be known as '''''Peking'''''.  It is located in the northern and eastern parts of the country.

The city of Beijing has played a very important role in the development of China. Many people from different cities and countries come to Beijing to look for better chances to find work. Nearly 15 million people live there. In 2008 Beijing hosted the [[Olympic Games]].

Beijing is well known for its ancient history.  Since the [[Jin dynasty]], Beijing has been the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of several [[dynasties]], including the Yuan, Ming, Qing, and others.  There are many places of historic interest in Beijing.  These places include the [[Summer Palace]], the Temple of Heaven, and the [[Great Wall of China]].

== Name ==
Beijing means &quot;the northern capital&quot; in the [[Chinese]] language.  It was once a counterpart of [[Nanjing]], &quot;the southern capital&quot;, during the Ming Dynasty.  This dynasty gave Beijing its name.

== History ==
The center of Beijing was settled in the [[1st millennium BC]]. In those days, the Kingdom of Yan (燕) set up their capital where Beijing is today.  They called it Ji (蓟). After the Kingdom of Yan was destroyed, the city became smaller, although it was still an important place.

Beijing became more important again in the 10th century, when the Jin dynasty set its capital there. This city was destroyed by [[Mongol]] forces in [[1215]].  Then in [[1267]], Mongols built a new city on the north side of the Jin capital, and called it &quot;Great Capital&quot; (大都), which was the beginning of modern Beijing. When Kublai Khan, the Mongolian monarch, set up the Yuan dynasty, this city became his capital.

The Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties all made Beijing their capitals. When the Qing dynasty lost power and the Republic of China was set up, the new Republic moved its capital from Beijing to Nanjing. When the People's Republic of China seized power, Beijing became the capital of China again.       

== Education ==
Beijing is the education center of People's Republic of China. More 500 famous universities of China are located in Beijing.  They also  include 5 of the top universities: Peking University, Tsinghua University, China People University, Beijing Normal University and Beihang University. Beijing is also education center of China for teaching Chinese as a foreign language. The standard Chinese pronunciation is based on Beijing dialect, so over 70% foreigners who want to study Chinese go to Beijing for their studies.

[[File:Berries (USDA ARS).jpg|250px|thumb|right|Several types of common &quot;berries&quot;. None is a berry by botanical definition:&lt;br /&gt;The blueberry is a [[false berry]], blackberries are [[aggregate fruit]], and strawberries are [[accessory fruit]].]]
The word '''berry''' is used for many different kinds of small [[fruit]]s that have many [[seeds]] and can be used as food. Some examples are [[strawberry]], [[raspberry]], [[blueberry]], and [[lingonberry]].
A berry can be either one fruit (like [[strawberry]]) or many fruits joined together like [[raspberry]]).

When [[botany|botanists]] talk about ''berries'', they mean a simple [[fruit]] produced from a single [[ovary (plant)|ovary]]. They sometimes call this ''true berry'', to distinguish it from ''false berries''. By that statement of how words are used, [[grape]]s or [[tomato]]es are true berries.

The berry is the most common type of soft fruit in which the entire ovary wall gets to the right stage of development of an [[pericarp]] which can be taken as food. The flowers of these plants have a upper ovary formed by the fusion of two or more [[carpels]]. The seeds are inside the soft body of the ovary.

Berries are small, sweet, liquid, bright colored fruits. Due to this, they are able to bring more [[animal]]s towards them and spread their [[seed]]s.

Some fruits that are called ''berries'' in [[English language|English]] are not ''true berries'' by the use of words above. These include [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[blackberry|blackberries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]] and [[boysenberry|boysenberries]]. Some true berries do not have ''berry'' in their name. These include [[tomato]]es, [[eggplants]], [[cranberries]], [[guava]]s, [[pomegranate]]s and [[chile pepper|chillies]]. [[Pumpkin]]s, [[cucumber]]s, [[melon]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] and [[lemon]]s are differently made berries.

To '''boil''' [[water]] is to make it hot so that it begins to make [[bubble]]s and turns into [[steam]].  Water boils at 100 degrees [[Celsius]] (212 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]). At high [[wikt:altitude|altitude]]s in the [[mountain]]s, water boils at a lower temperature, because of the lower [[atmospheric pressure]] in high places. 

To boil [[food]] is to [[cook]] it in boiling water.

The word &quot;boil&quot; also has a different meaning. A boil can also be an [[infection]] of the [[skin]]. A boil of the skin is a [[red]] place on the skin that is very [[painful]]. The person also may have a [[fever]].  The infection is caused by the [[bacteria]] ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''.

A '''beard''' is the [[hair]] growing on the lower part of a [[man]]'s [[face]].

The hair that grows on the upper [[lip]] of some men is a [[mustache]].  When a man has hair only below the lower lip and above the chin, it is called a [[soul patch]].  Some men have a lot of hair and a big beard, and some have very little. In the modern world, many men [[shave]] part or all of their beards, or cut their beard so it does not get very long. 

Some [[animal]]s also have hair like this, and people sometimes also call this hair a '''beard'''.

In light, '''black''' is lack of all [[color]].  In [[painting]], however, the black [[pigment]] is the combination of all colors.  In [[heraldry]], black is called &quot;sable&quot;.

== Meaning of black ==

Black is associated with power, elegance, formality, [[anarchy]], death, evil, and mystery.

Black is a color seen with fear and the unknown (black holes). It can have a bad meaning (blacklist, 'black death', black cat) or a good meaning ('in the black', 'black is beautiful'). Black can stand for strength and power. It can be a [[formal]], elegant, and high-class color (black tie, black Mercedes, black taco). Black clothing is common in [[emo]] and [[goth subculture]].

[[File:Plague -buboes.jpg|thumb|A person infected with bubonic plague]]
'''Bubonic plague''' is the best-known form of the disease [[plague]], which is caused by the [[bacterium]] [[Yersinia pestis]]. The name ''bubonic plague'' is specific for this form of the disease, which enters through the skin, and travels through the [[lymphatic system]]. 

If the disease is left untreated, it kills about half its victims, in between three and seven days. This disease may have been the [[Black Death]], a disease which killed tens of millions of people in Europe, in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/03/0310_040310_blackdeath.html|title=Bubonic Plague Traced to Ancient Egypt|first=Cameron|last=Walker|publisher=National Geographic News|date=10 March, 2004|accessdate=2 April, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Symptom]]s of this disease include [[cough]]ing, [[fever]], and black spots on the [[skin]]. 

== Different kinds of the same disease ==
There are different kinds of Bubonic plague. The most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of [[flea]], that lives on [[rat]]s. Then there is an [[incubation period]] which can last from a few hours to about seven days. 
=== Sepsis ===
A [[Sepsis]] happens when the bacterium enters the [[blood]]stream. 
=== Pneumonic plague ===
This happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs. About 95% of all people with this form will die. Incubation period is only one to two days.

=== The abortive form ===
This is the most harmless form. It will result in a little [[fever]]. After that, there are [[antibody|antibodies]] that protect against all forms for a long time.

== History ==
During the 1300s, this [[epidemic]] struck parts of [[Asia]], [[North Africa]], and [[Europe]]. Almost a third of the people in Europe died of it. Unlike [[catastrophe]]s that pull communities together, this epidemic was so terrifying that it broke people's trust in one another. [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], an [[Italy|Italian]] writer of the time, described it: ''&quot;This [[scourge]] had implanted so great a terror in the hearts of men and women that brothers [[abandon]]ed brothers, uncles their nephews, sisters their brothers, and in many cases wives deserted their husbands. But even worse,... fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;The decameron / Giovanni Boccaccio ; translated by Mark Musa &amp; Peter Bondanella ; with an introduction by Thomas G. Bergin. ISBN 0-451-52866-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transmission ==
The plague was not just carried by [[rat]]s as some people assume. The [[flea]]s also carried it. It came abroad from [[Kaffa]] by the [[Black Sea]]. From there the disease started to go new places in [[1347]]. It went to [[England]] in [[1349]]. There it killed '''half''' of the people in England. 70% of people who got plague died. Pigs are also to blame for the transmission, as the bacteria stayed in their blood system, and when eaten, people caught the plague. This is a reason why so few Jews caught the disease.

== Modern history ==
In the [[20th century]], some countries did [[research]] on the [[bacteria]] that causes bubonic plague. They did research to use it for [[biological warfare]].

Samples of this [[bacteria]] are carefully controlled. There is much [[paranoia]] (fear) about it. Dr. Thomas C. Butler, a [[United States|US]] expert in this [[organism]] was charged in October [[2003]] by the [[FBI]] with various [[crime]]s. This happened after he said he lost samples of ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. This is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague. The FBI did not find the samples. They do not know what happened to them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Biology''' is the [[science]] of life and living things, and their  [[evolution]]. Living things include [[plants]], [[animals]], [[fungi]] (such as [[mushroom]]s), and [[microorganisms]] such as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. 

People who study biology are called biologists. Biology looks at how animals and other organisms behave and work, and what they are like. Biology also studies how [[organism]]s react with each other and the [[environment]]. It has existed as a [[science]] for about 200 years, and was preceded by [[natural history]]. Biology has many [[research]] fields and [[branch]]es. Like all sciences, biology uses the [[scientific method]]. This means that biologists must be able to show [[evidence]] for their ideas, and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves. 

Biology attempts to answer questions like these:
&quot;What are the characteristics of this living thing?&quot; ([[comparative anatomy]]);
&quot;How do the parts work?&quot; ([[physiology]]);
&quot;How should we group living things?&quot; ([[classification]], [[taxonomy]]); 
&quot;What does this living thing do?&quot; ([[behaviour]], [[growth]]);
&quot;How does [[inheritance]] work? ([[genetics]]); &quot;What has been the history of life?&quot; ([[palaeontology]]). How do organisms relate to their [[environment]]? ([[ecology]]). All modern biology is influenced by [[evolution]], which answers the question: &quot;How has the living world come to be as it is?&quot;

'''Belgium''' (''België'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Belgique'' in [[French language|French]] and ''Belgien'' in [[German language|German]]) is a country in [[Europe]]. It is next to [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]]. The name 'Belgium' comes from 'Gallia Belgica', a Roman region in the northernmost part of Gaul where the Belgae lived, a combination of Celtic and Germanic peoples.

The [[capital city]] of Belgium is [[Brussels]].

There are three [[region]]s in Belgium: [[Flanders]] (where the [[Flemish]] speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) in the northern half of Belgium, [[Wallonia]] (where most [[Walloon]]s speak [[French language|French]]) in the southern half and the [[Brussels]]-Capital Region in the middle (where Dutch and French are spoken).  

Inside [[Wallonia]] is the area of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]].  The [[community]] has its own [[parliament]] and [[government]], but they are not yet as powerful as the Flemish and Walloon bodies.  

== Geography ==

Belgium is next to [[France]] (620 km), [[Germany]] (167 km), [[Luxembourg]] (148 km) and the [[Netherlands]] (450 km). Its total area, with surface water area, is 33,990 [[square kilometers]], the land area alone is 30,528 km². Belgium has three main geographical regions: the coastal plain in the north-west and the central plateau are part of the Anglo-Belgian Basin; the [[Ardennes]] uplands in the south-east are part of the Hercynian orogenic belt. The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgium's southernmost tip, Belgian Lorraine.
The coastal plain is made up of mainly of [[sand dune]]s and [[polder]]s. Further inland lies a smooth, slowly rising landscape watered by many waterways, with fertile [[valley]]s and the northeastern sandy plain of the Campine (Kempen). The hills with many [[forest]]s and [[plateau]]s of the Ardennes are more rough and rocky with caves and small, narrow valleys. Extending to the west into France, this area is eastwardly linked to the Eifel in Germany by the High Fens plateau, on which the Signal de Botrange forms the country's highest point at 694 metres (2,277 ft).

==Politics and Government==

Belgium is a [[federal]] country. There are three regions, the Dutch-speaking [[Flemish Region]], the French-speaking [[Walloon Region]] and the [[Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels capital region]]. Although Brussels is surrounded by the Flemish Region its importance as the national capital means it is a special bilingual (two-language) zone. There is a fourth language group, the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German speaking community]] of the Walloon Region, with an elected assembly and its own Minister President. 

The regions are divided into ten provinces:
#[[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]]
#[[East Flanders]]
#[[Flemish Brabant]]
#[[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]]
#[[Liège (province)|Liege]]
#[[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]]
#[[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Luxembourg]]
#[[Namur (province)|Namur]]
#[[Walloon Brabant]]
#[[West Flanders]].

The provinces are divided into 589 communes.

'''Brazil''' is a [[country]] in [[South America]]. It is the [[earth|world]]'s fifth largest country. The country has a [[population]] of 201,103,330 people.  People in Brazil speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and it is the only country in Latin America that speaks [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]; most of the others speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The [[capital (city)|capital]] of Brazil is [[Brasília]], a city planned and built from 1957 to 1960.

== Geographics ==
Brazil has the world's largest [[rain forest]], the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. It makes up 40% of the country's land area. Brazil also has other types of land; there is a type of [[savanna]] called ''cerrado''; there is also a dry plant region named ''caatinga''. ''Caatinga'' means ''white vegetation'' in Tupi, a native language of Brazil.

Brazil is known for [[soccer]], but it also has many other things: a varied culture (influenced by people who have come from many countries), and a growing [[economy]]. Brazil is the largest country and in [[South America]] and the largest economy in [[Latin America]]. Its people include people of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] or other [[Europe]]an descent, [[Africa]]n descent, and [[Indigenous peoples|native Amerindians]], as well as many people of [[Mulatto|mixed origins]]. Brazil also has the biggest number of [[Japan]]ese descendents outside Japan. The country is the fifth largest in the world by area. It is known for its numerous rainforests and jungles. It neighbours [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[French Guiana]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], therefore it borders every country in South America, with the exception of two, [[Chile]] and [[Ecuador]].

The most important cities are [[São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Salvador]], [[Brasília]], [[Curitiba]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Porto Alegre]], [[Recife]], [[Fortaleza (Brazil)|Fortaleza]], [[Manaus]], [[Goiânia]] and [[Vitória (Brazil)|Vitória]].

People from Brazil are called ''Brazilians''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=brazilian |title=WordNet Search - 3.0 |work=wordnetweb.princeton.edu |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''brasileiros'' in Brazilian Portuguese language).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Summerland''' is the name given by Wiccans and other Pagans (old European religions) to their belief of afterlife (life after death). Commonly, Summerland is a place of rest for souls or spirits in between their incarnations (life on earth). It is believed to be a place of beauty and peace. It is described as a place of green hills and lush grass. Most believers say that the soul has little memory of Summerland when it comes back into life. The Summerland is also a place for meeting with deceased loved ones.
Some believe that, after experiencing many lives, they will stay in Summerland for eternity (always).
